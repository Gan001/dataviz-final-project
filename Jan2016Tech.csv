Audience members arriving at the 3LD Art & Technology Center in Lower Manhattan were warned of strobe lighting effects, but it was the scenes of graphic violence that made some want to avert their eyes. Most disturbing of all, perhaps, Ms. Du and her brilliant librettist, Royce Vavrek, refuse to moralize. Their tale of two angels who crash-land in a suburban backyard and come to be maimed, exploited and brutally violated by hitherto unremarkable residents is presented as a parable without take-away lessons.

The story unfolds in the home of Mr. and Mrs. X.E., who are struggling financially until the two angels tumble into their yard. Something lights up in Mrs. X.E.: “We need this,” she tells her husband, and urges him to prune their wings and keep them captive. The angels’ feathers have intoxicating powers and draw the curiosity and envy of the neighbors, who soon come to pay for time spent with the “innocent creatures.”

The cast (all amplified) was led by the incisive soprano Abigail Fischer as Mrs. X.E., who compares herself to the Virgin Mary at the Annunciation even as she conducts business deals with prospective clients. As her husband, the baritone Kyle Pfortmiller was powerfully effective, capable of glib smoothness in the cabaret-style number “They Will Love You” and of summoning terrifying pathos in a climactic scene in which he falls victim to the violence he has wielded.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/08/arts/music/review-in-angels-bone-terrified-seraphim-at-the-mercy-of-mortals.html

“We have users in every country in the world, but in order to get to the next phase of our business and grow faster, we needed a partner,” Carter McJunkin, chief operating officer of Grindr, said in an interview. Mr. McJunkin said the pairing made sense for Grindr because of Beijing Kunlun’s digital expertise, and its agreement to let Grindr’s founders continue its operating structure and retain its current team.

For Beijing Kunlun, Grindr offers a chance to expand beyond its core gaming assets and into other lifestyle categories, as well as markets outside China.

“We have been very impressed by Grindr’s progress to date and are extremely excited about the future of the company,” Yahui Zhou, chairman of Kunlun, said in a statement. “We will continue to seek out and invest in high-quality technology companies led by top-tier management across the globe.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/technology/grindr-sells-stake-to-chinese-company.html

Re “The Dirty Truth About ‘Clean Diesel’ ” (Op-Ed, Jan. 3):

Here are the facts about diesel straight from the Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board: Clean diesel technology and fuels have reduced particulate matter and nitrogen oxide emissions by more than 98 percent, and sulfur content by 97 percent. The American Lung Association cites clean diesel fleets as one of the two primary reasons for improved air quality in the United States.

Diesel remains the technology of choice for the trucks, ships, trains and machines of our industrialized world — including more than two-thirds of all public transit buses — because it works, providing the best combination of efficiency, power, reliability and now environmental performance. Just before the Paris climate talks, San Francisco and Oakland announced that their municipal fleets would use clean diesel technology and renewable diesel fuels instead of alternative fuels.

The bank, run by Jamie Dimon, is one of the industry’s top performers. Yet its annualized return on equity for the three months to December was just 9 percent — and it relied on one-offs to get there. New technology offers a way to increase both revenue and savings.

JPMorgan has done a lot to improve its operations in recent months. Core loans grew 5 percent from 2015’s third quarter and 16 percent over the course of the year. The bank cut many capital-intensive assets, including tough-to value ones, noncore deposits and over-the-counter derivatives. That means the capital buffer it is required to maintain as a systemically important financial institution ought to drop from 4.5 percent of total assets in 2014 to 3.5 percent now.

Yet JPMorgan and its competitors seem destined to amble along with returns on equity slightly above or below the 10 percent considered enough to cover a big bank’s cost of capital.
