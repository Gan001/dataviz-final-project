of 1The japan ground properly so called consists of the varnish and pigment where the whole surface is to be of one simple colour or of the varnish with or without pigment on which some painting or other form of decoration is afterwards to be applied It is best to form this ground with the desired pigment incorporated with shellac varnish except in the case of a white japan ground which requires special treatment or when great brilliancy is a desideratum and other methods must be adopted The shellac varnish for the japan ground is best prepared as follows shellac 114 lb methylated spirits 1 gallon Dissolve in a wellcorked vessel in a warm place and with frequent shaking After two or three days the shellac will be dissolved It is then recommended to filter the solution through a flannel bag and when all that will come through freely has done so the varnish should be run into a proper sized vessel and kept carefully corked for use The bag may then be squeezed with the hand till the remainder of the fluid varnish is forced through it and this if fairly clear may be used for rough purposes or added to the next batch Pigments of any nature whatever may be used with the shellac varnish to give the desired tint to the ground and where necessary they may be mixed together to form any compound colour such as blue and yellow to form green The pigments used for japan grounds should all be previously ground very smooth in spirits of turpentine so smooth that the paste does not grate between the two thumb nails and then only are they mixed with the varnish This mixture of pigment and varnish vehicle should then be spread over the surface to be japanned very carefully and very evenly with a camelhair brush As metals do not require a priming coat of size and whiting the japan ground may be applied to metallic surfaces forthwith without any preliminary treatment except thorough cleansing except in the cases specially referred to further on On metallic surfaces three to four coats are applied and in the interval between each coat the articles must be stoved in an oven heated to from 250 to 300 FThe figure shows a section through single chamber japanning and

His look was so bold and masculine that people likened him to Hercules His democratic manners endeared him to the army He wore a plain tunic covered with a large coarse mantle and carried a huge sword at his side despising ostentation Even his faults and follies added to his popularity He would sit down at the common soldiers mess and drink with them telling them stories and clapping them on the back He spent money like water quickly recognizing any daring deed which his legionaries performed In this respect he was like Napoleon and like Napoleon he had a vein of florid eloquence which was criticized by literary men but which went straight to the heart of the private soldier In a word he was a powerful virile passionate able man rough as were nearly all his countrymen but strong and true Holes in leaves of pepper plantimafan26Fig 6C0 The wedding of the two bastards was most splendid rich with the double pomp of Church and King As the pope had settled that the young bridal pair should live near him Caesar Borgia the new cardinal undertook to manage the ceremony of their entry into Rome and the reception and Lucrezia who enjoyed at her fathers side an amount of favour hitherto unheard of at the papal court desired on her part to contribute all the splendour she had it in her power to add He therefore went to receive the young people with a stately and magnificent escort of lords and cardinals while she awaited them attended by the loveliest and noblest ladies of Rome in one of the halls of the Vatican A throne was there prepared for the pope and at his feet were cushions far Lucrezia and Dona Sancia Thus writes Tommaso Tommasi by the look of the assembly and the sort of conversation that went on for hours you would suppose you were present at some magnificent and voluptuous royal audience of ancient Assyria rather than at the severe consistory of a Roman pontiff whose solemn duty it is to exhibit in every act the sanctity of the name he bears But continues the same historian if the Eve of Pentecost was spent in such worthy functions the celebrations of the coming of the Holy Ghost on the following day were no less decorous and becoming to the spirit of the Church for thus writes the master of the ceremonies in his journal IF U WERE KILLED TOMORROW I WOULDNT GO 2 UR FUNERAL CUZ ID B N JAIL 4 KILLIN DA PERSON THAT KILLED UThe pope made his entry into the Church of the Holy Apostles and beside him on the marble steps of the pulpit where the canons of St Peter are wont to chant the Epistle and Gospel sat Lucrezia his daughter and

therefore a great and striking figure in the history of civilization Nevertheless he would today be remembered only by scholars and students of the Middle Ages were it not for the fact that he inspired the most enduring love that history records If Heloise had never loved him and if their story had not been so tragic and so poignant he would be today only a name known to but a few His final

       "   'text': 'Amazon closes down its shopping-focused Instagram rival Spark (updated) Spark was a discovery shopping service with shoppable feeds. Sponsored Links kasinv via Getty Images\\nAmazon Spark , the e-commerce giant\\'s social network, has seemingly shut down after only a couple of years. If you don\\'t even know what it is, we don\\'t blame you. You can think of it as Amazon\\'s version of Instagram, except it focuses on shopping discovery and was never quite as popular. Users can tag products available on Amazon on their posts, since the service is specifically aimed at Prime subscribers. As TechCrunch has noted, the service has vanished from the face of the internet, with the amazon.com/spark URL now redirecting to the new #FoundItOnAmazon page.\\nA spokesperson told us:\\n\"We are always experimenting with new experiences to delight customers. We are currently testing #FoundItOnAmazon, a new experience to inspire shoppers looking for fashion styles and home décor. #FoundItOnAmazon is based on the insights from these past experiments. It is currently available to a portion of our customers.\"\\nThe publication has also noticed that Spark is no longer a swipe away from the mobile site\\'s navigation menu. Amazon went back to using a hamburger menu and no longer shows Spark updates like it used to. Spark\\'s FAQs are still online, but if you Google the service and click on the links, you\\'ll find that most of them don\\'t work anymore.\\nWhile the spokesperson didn\\'t give us more details about Spark\\'s fate, TC says one of the possible reasons why the social network shut down was because the Amazon VP of Consumer Engagement, Chee Chew, left the company for Twilio in early 2019. Chew was heavily invested in Spark, and Amazon might have decided that keeping it alive is no longer worth it without him.\\nUpdate 6/16 1:20PM ET: An Amazon spokesperson told Engadget that Spark was \"not gone entirely,\" and instead characterized this as the company having \"pivoted and narrowed\" to the #FoundItOnAmazon project. People had \"already been using\" that hashtag on social networks, so it changed the name to reflect that, the spokesperson said.',\n",

       "   'text': \"Search: Investors Are Selling Arista: Here's Why They're Wrong The company that builds custom systems for the titans of the internet knows more than almost anyone what's needed to grow and scale in a cloud-first world. Tim Beyers ( TMFMileHigh\\nShares of Arista Networks ( NYSE:ANET ) are slightly lagging the market year to date after losing 21.7% of their value last month . Failure to find sufficient new, short-term growth from cloud titan customers such as Amazon.com , Facebook , and Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) has some Arista investors hitting the panic button. ANET data by YCharts .\\nSellers aren't giving Arista nearly enough credit for its positioning and relationships with customers that have long been its bread and butter. What went wrong\\nYou wouldn't know that from the numbers. First-quarter revenue grew 26% year over year versus 40.8% in last year's Q1. It was also the third consecutive quarter in which revenue growth declined sequentially and the fourth in which Arista failed to boost revenue by at least 30%. The Arista story appears to be deteriorating, so it's natural for some sellers to jump ship.\\nAnd yet it's not that simple. Arista is in a complicated business with multiple moving parts, so trying to define its relevance by the ebb and flow of replacement cycles in data center infrastructure is unfair. Here's how CEO Jayshree Ullal described the issue with its biggest customers in the May 2 conference call with analysts:\\nWe saw less than the normal order strength in late March and the month of April... the massive cloud titan providers [orders] fulfilled in 2018 have led to a period of absorption in the first half of 2019. In particular, 1 cloud titan has placed most orders on hold for Q2 2019.\\nTranslation: We work side by side with the biggest names in the cloud to make equipment that fits their needs. One of those companies is telling us they'll delay some purchases they'd planned so it's going to take a while to collect that revenue. Why it's a mistake to see this as a miss\\nWe can't know for sure which cloud titan is delaying orders, but to presume those days equate to an exploitable weakness that's bound to reappear quarter after quarter is a mistake. Arista's relationships are too strong. Case in point, the photo below, tweeted on June 6, shows Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella joining Arista's five-year IPO celebration. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella celebrating Arista's five-year IPO anniversary with the management team. Image source: Arista Networks.\\nTalk about sending a message. Analysts had been speculating that Microsoft was the cloud titan delaying orders. It took Arista a month to first announce a new expanded partnership for cloud networking on Microsoft Azure. Two days later, Nadella joined Arista for its five-year party.\\nAnd why not? Gartner forecasts public cloud services revenue growing 17.5% this year alone and then growing another 50% in the ensuing three years -- to $331.2 billion worldwide by 2022. Microsoft is jockeying to seize an outsized portion of that revenue; Arista is a key partner in that effort. Arista's poised for growth\\nTo put a finer point on it, Arista is increasingly providing the engines that allow the public cloud titans to serve a large and insatiable market. Massive growth won't come in a straight line, but it will come again. Expect the stock to respond when it does. Author ( TMFMileHigh ) Tim Beyers first began writing for the Fool in 2003.

       "   'text': 'by AnnaBookBel On the Line by Alice Vinten\\nWe are all fascinated by other peoples’ lives these days. Narrative non-fiction as publishers call the mixture that includes history, politics, biography and memoir – any non-fiction that tells a story. Doctors and surgeons’ memoirs, have been joined by nurses, midwives, chefs, firemen, barristers and more, and now by a policewoman. Alice Vinten’s memoir of her ten years as a WPC in the Metropolitan Police was published last year and is now out in paperback.\\nVinten’s memoir takes us from her first days at Hendon, the Met’s training college, through to her resignation, ten years later. Each chapter takes a particular police case as its focus, but she doesn’t shy away from telling us about what happens off duty too, about her own life’s dramas, one of which occurs in the first chapter at Hendon.\\nTears well in my eyes as I look down at the stick. Nine weeks into my training and I’m pregnant. Pregnant and sitting in the urine-scented toilets at Metropolitan Police training college, Hendon. …\\n‘We’ll say you’ve had a family emergency.’ ‘One more thing.’ He leans forward, his elbows resting on his pressed black trousers, silver sergeant stripes glinting on his shoulders. ‘I don’t think you should tell your parents.’ ‘Why?’ I hear myself ask, my voice claggy and wet. ‘I just think it will be easier if you don’t.’ And just like that, I make a decision that I will regret for another twelve years of my life.\\nTrying to put her abortion behind her, she throws herself into learning about the job she’s always wanted to do. She is honest about the gritty reality of modern policing – for every shout that gets the adrenaline racing, requiring physical resilience and eyes in the back of your head – there are countless encounters with those who are powerless to help their own lives. There is constant verbal abuse, often threats, repeat offenders, victims, and dead bodies lain undiscovered in houses. The daily stress of the job is immense, and when she goes home at night the day’s events will replay over and over, sleep is hard to come by. It’s grueling, it’s draining – but there are positive moments too when you can help people – it’s not totally grim. She really does love the job – at least at the start.\\nA few years later, Vinten is in a steady relationship with another police officer – as many doctors marry other doctors or nurses, the unique pressures of the job often preclude finding partners from outside of the profession. Pregnant again, this time, her partner is overjoyed. Returning to the job after maternity leave is difficult though, and now, having a young son, she started to find that that affected the job. Being able to be there for her son, but also understanding what it is like to be a parent – and a repeat encounter with a young girl she’d met several years earlier proves to be the breaking point. She was then able to pursue her other dream – to be a writer.\\nI came away from this book with a new-found respect for the work of the police, and even more for the WPCs who are overcoming the legacy of the institutionalised sexism that used to dominate the Met. Although, of course, names and locations have been changed to protect identities, (Brixley, the station she is assigned to is the name given to the Hendon in-house training complex), everything she recounts feels very real, from having to conduct a search on an unwilling female in the cells, to being out in the panda car and putting on the ‘blues and twos’. It’s not a life that I would ever have chosen, but it makes for a truly gripping, eye-opening and rather emotional read.

       "   'text': \"\\nHappy Sabbath and Good afternoon\\nBeautiful day but tough week for me. I guess the job was not for me. Seventy five percent of me now thinks it was a scam and now I have to watch my bank account to make sure no funny business is going on. I came upon the job looking on craigs list..it was actually with Amazon and although I went to a recruiting event, completed some training stuff online and showed up at the site to do in person training, I have not been paid for that first day, received this knet email they kept saying would be sent to my inbox, and I reached out many times, requesting a call back from HR to not get any contact. I kept checking and checking my email constantly for nothing. I even asked the person who claimed to be the manager I would work under to send it to another email address I have and still nothing. I ultimately removed the work links they gave me and blocked any further messages because I don’t trust it any more. I wasted my time and it is one of the things that got me down.\\nI had an embarrassing time at a work meeting I had, but because of everything else that was happening, I didn’t even feel the embarrassment. I was numb to any feeling really during that meeting.\\nI’m down about other stuff but I don’t want to talk about it. I went to church today and am thankful for a chance to pray with another sister. I stayed upstairs for a while playing hymns before heading down to pick up a delicious lunch and retrieve my son.\\nI am thankful for time with my son. After three weeks, I will not see him until the end of August and I am going to miss him and be lonely. For the longest I was so used to being by myself and enjoying peace and quiet. The last time my son was away from me, it was for a month and it was odd not having him around. I talk to him every day and enjoy having him around (he makes my days interesting in fun). It’s going to be hard, two months.\\nGod makes such beautiful things doesn't He? Look at the flowers, the grasses of the field. There is so much beauty in our world and the Lord created these things and I enjoy them so much. My mother gave me the start of a plant. We don’t know what it is, but when she pointed out these tall upright fuschia colored flowers, I knew I had to have that in my garden. I've been against planting flowers in the front of my house but that changed real quick. After she gave that to me I believe on Wednesday morning, I spent the next hour planting the blue delphinims, daisy, and gladiolas in the same bed. Later that afternoon, I stopped by my private garden center that carries rare varieties of plants and then later Lowes and planted a bunch of dark pink phlox, more delphinims, some fluffy soft grey-green foliage, aster and other perennials in the front yard. I then went to my mother’s home and she gave me huge cuts of hydrangeas (their hydrangas are as tall as 1.5 stories and cover large portions of the south eastern side of the house, it’s shocking they have grown so tall and full) and a pinkish purple and white yarrows (also grows really tall). Can you believe Lowes wanted $15 for a tiny bunch of hydrangea? I love blue flowers. My mother told me to soak the cuttings in water, tap the ends in rooting powder and plant them in deep holes. I don’t know if it will work but for some reason, she does this and they just take off all around the house. I dug holes, put in good soil and did as she told me. I really hope they survive and grow as tall as hers so I can completely block the view of cul-de-sac guy’s house from where I live. Or at last cut down on the grass I need to cut at the bottom of the hill.\\nI am thankful for a beautiful home, beautiful plants, for family, for my church. I am thankful for the Lord’s provisions. I hope to share good news and positivity next week. Next week is not the average Sabbath for me. The following two Sabbaths I will be in North Carolina and will have to plan out what church I will go to and how I will get around. I look forward to these events and what the Lord will do.\\nIt was a tough week, but the Lord helped me through it. That’s all that matters. \",\n",

       "   'text': 'Thanks for stopping by to check out my SwagBucks review . One of the most common questions I get about making money online is about reward sites that pay you for things like shopping, playing games, and doing online surveys.\\nI mean... getting paid to do things online? It must be a scam, right?\\nSo of course, the first question is usually are they legit and safe ? The second question is which ones do I recommend? I have to say… Swagbucks is at the top of my list and I’ll explain the reasons why below. We’ll also unpack the countless Swagbucks reviews to find the good things and the not-so good things people are saying... and why some might even call Swagbucks a scam.\\nDisclaimer:\\nPlease note, this Swag Bucks review has been researched with information and/or testimonials that are available online in the public domain. Any recommendations and/or conclusions are strictly opinions and may not to apply to, or agree with, all persons or situations. See full disclaimer for more info\\nWhat is Swagbucks? Swagbucks is an online rewards website that pays you for things like participating in paid surveys, watching videos, signing up for free trials and a dozen of other online activities.\\nBased out of El Segundo, California and owned by a company called Prodege LLC (who also owns MyPoints )… Swagbucks is one of the most popular reward sites online today.\\nHow Does It Work? Signing up is easy, and it’s also free. You can either join with your email (my preferred method) or by using your Facebook account.\\nBest known for their online surveys… they also offer a multitude of earning opportunities which really sets them apart from similar websites.\\nI should be mentioned early in this review though that we’re not talking about big money. Most people report earnings of anywhere from $5 and $10 per month, to as much as $75 and $80.\\nThat might not sound like much, but if you spend your spare time accumulating rewards (called swagbucks ) over several months or a year, it’ll give you a good head-start on things like Christmas shopping and summer vacations.\\nBut before I get into the many ways you can earn, let’s deal with the most common question I get… is it a scam?\\nIs Swagbucks Surveys a Scam? Earning online is still one of those mysterious things that people are aware of, but don\\'t really understand. Telling someone you make money online is almost like telling them you\\'ve seen a UFO or Bigfoot.\\nOf course many will think it’s a scam... or at the very least, question if it\\'s safe and it\\'s understandable why they\\'d be concerned. There\\'s are so many scams and fake sites out there it\\'s almost impossible to know which ones are legit and which ones are out to rip you off.\\nWhen it comes to Swagbucks, the scam accusations are minimal… but there is one area where people get suspicious, which is...\\nQualifying For Surveys There are a lot of great online opportunities out there, but it\\'s a fact... there\\'s also a ton of baloney. And with Swagbucks… we\\'re not talking about a flat-out scam here (the kind that rips you off and you never hear from them again).\\nThe issue here is that people end up wasting their time and sharing personal information while trying to qualify for surveys...\\nThe reason for qualifying is because market research companies are looking for specific demographics to target, and depending on your situation… it can be difficult to get accepted.\\nIf you don\\'t qualify, you don\\'t get paid for your time.\\nFor example… if you’re single with no kids and rent a room in someone’s house… you simply won’t qualify for as many surveys as a parent with young kids who also owns two cars, a house, takes annual vacations and for good measure has a medical issue or two.\\nAnd it makes sense. The most common purpose for market research is to identify buyers and improve products and services.\\nIf you own a lot of things, you are considered a buyer. If you have specific needs like medical requirements for example, you are a buyer.\\nIf you have a lot of experiences (particularly with products and services) you opinion on how a product or service can be improved is more valuable.\\nA lot of people lie about their situations though, so to qualify for you must complete pre-qualifying surveys which often include a lot of personal questions. Since you don’t get paid for these, the suspicious person often wonders if the information they are sharing is being sold anyway.\\nThat’s one reason some might accuse Swagbucks surveys of being a scam… but it’s usually just out of frustration of repeatedly trying but never qualifying.\\nAs I write this review, Swagbucks is approaching 300 million dollars paid out to members. I’m not sure what your bank account looks like… but for me, hundreds of millions is a lot of money.\\nThere may be some complaints and unhappy members… but Swagbucks is definitely legitimate and safe.\\nWho is Swagbucks For? Swagbucks is great for the first-time online income earner or the person who has spare time and is looking for a simple way to earn some gift cards.\\nIf you’ve never made money online before… Swag Bucks is an easy way to get in and feel what it’s like. You won’t make a lot of money, and you definitely won’t be quitting your day job, but it’s a start.\\nYou can also combine it with other online survey sites like Survey Junkie which increases your survey opportunities and chances you\\'ll qualify.\\nWho It\\'s Not For If you’re serious about making money online and hate the 9 to 5 grind, an online business might be what you\\'re looking for.\\nThe real power of the web is that it gives you an ability to produce something once and make money from it repeatedly… to build a passive income .\\nEarning a passive income might even be something you need because of health issues for example or children at home you need to look after.\\nKnowing how (and where) to start is what you need in order to get what you want .\\nNow, I\\'m going to give you a free step by step beginner\\'s guide to making money online and you can get it by clicking HERE .\\nEarning swagbucks by doing small tasks doesn\\'t give you the leverage an online business can give you though. You can however earn money with SwagBucks\\' referral program (which I’ll talk about more below).\\nI\\'m not sure what your financial goals are, but I like to do things once and earn passive income\\nWhat Is a ‘Swagbuck’ and How Do You Earn Them? A swagbuck is basically a ‘point’ . Most reward sites pay you in \\'points\\'… Swagbucks cleverly calls them swagbucks .\\nOne swagbuck (or SB) is equal to one cent and they can be redeemed for dozens of different gift cards as well as PayPal cash.\\nSo… how do you earn swagbucks ?\\nAside from the surveys which we already discussed, I\\'ll break down the many ways you can make money with Swagbucks. The easiest ways, the best ways and even the riskier strategies you may want to avoid.\\nFirst though... an important question.\\nDoes Swagbucks Actually Work? Most people don\\'t make money from their couch, so when it comes to sites like Swagbucks it\\'s common to feel like something isn\\'t quite right. I mean... who\\'s going to pay you to do small tasks online, right?\\nThere are also a lot sites out there making big promises but either failing to deliver... or just flat-out ripping people off.\\nSwagbucks definitely has it\\'s customer service issues and complaints, but as far as make-money-online sites go... it\\'s one of the better ones...\\nSo to answer that question, yes Swagbucks works.\\nThe Fastest Ways to Make Money with Swagbucks Let’s begin by defining the word fast and talking about expectations when it comes to making money.\\nFor example, if you need $500 by the end of the month to pay off a credit card bill… Swagbucks is not going to get you there.\\nOn the other hand… if $500 in a year to help with Christmas is what you’re hoping for, you’ve come to the right place.\\nOne s wagbuck (SB) is roughly equal to one cent ($0.01) and they do add up, but you only have 24 hours in a day, so it’s going to take time to accumulate them… whether you do it fast or slow.\\nSo, fast does not mean instant and it also doesn’t mean easy (I’ll get to the easiest ways to make money with Swagbucks below). It means putting in some effort to accumulate as many Swagbucks as possible… as fast as possible.\\nOnline Surveys We\\'ll start with surveys because they are on the higher end of the payout scale… between 50 – 300 SB’s per survey, and surveys \"average\" about 20 minutes in length.\\nBut there’s a catch…\\nYou can also waste five or ten minutes trying to qualify for surveys.\\nSince surveys are targeted at specific demographic groups, this can get frustrating. You\\'ll spend a lot of time trying to find the right surveys for you, but you do eventually find them and it can be one of the faster ways to rack up your points (your swagbucks).\\nTo increase your survey opportunities you can also join legit sites that specialize in online surveys like Survey Junkie .\\nReferrals For the right person, this can also be an extremely fast way to accumulate swagbucks. Finding referrals and getting them to sign up is the hardest part, but if you have a lot of friends and family, or even an online following… you will earn 10% of everything they make on Swagbucks (excluding their referral bonuses, swag codes, and daily goal bonus).\\nAlso... when your referral earns 300 SB before the first day of the following month, you with both also earn a 300 SB bonus.\\nIt’s not the fastest strategy out of the gate (because referrals can be difficult to get)… but in the long-run you are multiplying your swagbucks and earning passive income. Some would say this is the only way to really earn money with Swagbucks.\\nSpecial Offers and Free Trials Inside your account you’ll find a “discover” tab which lists a bunch of offers (such as subscription trials to Audible for example) and when you sign up you earn swagbucks. Some of these offers are free and others are paid.\\nIt goes without saying… don’t spend money on offers you wouldn’t normally pay for just because the SB payout is good. However... if you do find something you were going to pay for anyway… you might as well get it here and add to your SB total.\\nDaily Goal As a result of hitting it hard and going for the maximum number of SB’s… Swagbucks will reward you for hitting certain targets.\\nEach day they give you a goal, and if you can hit it they’ll reward you with a few extra Swagbucks (usually around 10%).\\nBut we’re just getting started…\\nThe Easiest Ways to Make Money with Swagbucks The Surveys and Referrals discussed above may offer the highest returns… but they also require the most effort.\\nFortunately... Swagbucks also offers easy ways to earn by doing things you’d normally do online anyway.\\nIt should be noted that we’re not talking about a lot of money here (I mean… a swagbuck is only worth a penny), but the game is to accumulate as many as possible, so every little bit helps.\\nSearching the Web There’s a good chance that you search the web everyday using either Google , Bing , or another search engine. What you might not know though, is that Swagbucks has their own search engine and you can earn up to 25 – 50 swagbucks per day by using theirs instead.\\nGoogle and Bing are certainly the gold standard when it comes to finding relevant information online, but having used the Swagbucks search engine, it does a really good job…\\nWatching Videos What could be easier than watching videos and getting paid?\\nWell... how about not watching them and letting them play in the background while you do something else? I shouldn\\'t recommend that... but it is one way people are maximizing their SB count.\\nYou can set up the Swagbucks TV app and let it run (while checking periodically because sometimes it will pause) and earn up to 150 SB a day. On average, you’ll be getting 2 - 3 swagbucks per video.\\nSwag button By simply installing the swagbutton, which notifies you of shopping offers and allows you to play videos in the corner of the screen… you can earn another SB per day.\\nGames If you have a game addiction, this is what you’ve been looking for. You can earn up to 10 SB per game.\\nIf you’re really into games and regularly pay for them, they offer even higher SB rewards when you play popular games such as Tetris, or online slot machines.\\nDaily Poll Everyday in the right-hand sidebar, there is a daily poll. It only pays one swagbuck… but it also only takes 2 seconds, a click, and you’re done.\\nDaily Offer (NOSO) These are no obligation special offers (NOSO) … meaning you can go through them, skip each one, and still earn 2 SB for a few seconds of your time.\\nSwagbuck Codes As a way to keep you engaged with Swagbucks… they pepper their site and social media with special codes that when entered (into the safe icon at the top of your account page) are good for some instant points.\\nYou can install the Swagbucks browser extension (50 SB just for downloading) and get notified when new codes become available… or you can skip the treasure hunt and find codes at sbcodz.com .\\nReward Sales and Discounts Another simple way to maximize your swagbucks is to redeem them when gift cards go on sale.\\nOnce a month Swagbucks discounts certain gift cards. For example, a $25 card that would normally cost 2500 SB, may go on sale for 2200 SB (a 12% discount).\\nWhen you add it all up (videos playing in the background, using the Swagbucks search engine, discounts, etc.) you can really pad your account with swagbucks that others miss out on.\\nThe Riskiest Ways to Make Money with Swagbucks Okay… when I say risky, I’m not talking about dumping your savings into bitcoin or swimming with sharks. What I mean is that Swagbucks is not just about making money… it can also tempt you to spend money.\\nAnd, if you\\'re spending more than you\\'re making on things you don\\'t need... Swagbucks may be hurting, not helping.\\nShopping One of the popular ways to accumulate SB is by shopping.\\nYou may have heard of affiliate marketing, which is a way for regular people like you and I to earn commissions by referring people to places like Amazon, Groupon, Expedia and even popular retailers like Home Depot, Sephora and Old Navy.\\nSwagbucks is also an affiliate partner with these brands and earns a commission when you buy something from them (at no extra cost to you) . Instead of keeping the entire commission… they share it with you by adding to your SB total (anywhere from 1 – 5 percent of the amount you spend).\\nThe reason I consider this risky is because chances are, most people will see something they had no intention of buying and instead of earning swagbucks… they’ll be spending real bucks. It kind of defeats the purpose.\\nBut… if shopping is your thing, you might as well add to your SB earnings while you’re at it.\\nPrint and Redeem Coupons This is the same as shopping. You can earn up to 10 SB when you print and redeem a coupon which is great if you’re only buying things you’d normally buy anyway… but more often than not you end up with a few grocery items that were never on your list.\\nSweepstakes (aka Swagstakes) I think this one speaks for itself. Instead of redeeming your swagbucks for cold-hard gift cards… you can gamble them away in the high-stakes world of SB roulette.\\nThe Best Way to Make Money with Swagbucks? It all depends on your situation. If you shop a lot… you might find some great deals and SB rewards that make the most sense for you.\\nIf you work a job where you can play videos in the background… then that might be the best way.\\nIn most cases, the \"best way\" will be a combination of everything (although, I don\\'t recommend throwing your swagbucks away on sweepstakes).\\nWhen you add up everything , it’s not unheard of for people to make $500 - $1000 per year in gift cards. That\\'s a lot of time doing surveys, getting referrals and playing games, but it\\'s possible. And, you can do it while sitting around home, waiting in the doctor\\'s office... or if you\\'re like me, standing around while my wife and daughters shop for clothes\\nAt present… the total amount of money that Swagbucks has paid out is approaching $300 million, so there is plenty to go around.\\nIf you have more time on your hands or you\\'d like to earn a full-time income online, an online business might be what you\\'re looking for.\\nA health issue for example, kids at home to look after or a difficult job market can make an income at home more than just a nice thing to have, but also the peace of mind you\\'ve been looking for.\\nKnowing how to get started, and who you can trust is what you need in order to get what you want .\\nNow, I\\'m going to give you a free step by step beginner\\'s guide to making money online and you can get it by clicking HERE .\\nFor further opportunities you can also check out this list of more than two hundred work-at-home gigs and side hustles .\\nSwagbucks Reviews and Complaints Like most online companies, Swagbucks can stake their claim to both positive and negative reviews… but the good news is that the comments are overwhelmingly good (which is rare for sites like these).\\nAmong the positive things people are saying…\\nIt’s relatively easy to earn $50 - $75 each month because Swagbucks offer so many ways to earn. It’s fun… Those who use it for shopping see it as a cash-back type website. Some people even claim to have given up on other similar sites and only use Swagbucks now, which is probably one of the best compliments you can give them. Before you get too excited though, having read through hundreds of reviews, there are some common compliants that consistently come up…\\nThe surveys take longer to complete than advertised… and if you’re doing them often, all of those extra minutes add up. Not enough surveys and too difficult to qualify (a common complaint among most survey sites). And… unfortunately, there are some BBB complaints about people having their accounts closed for no reason or not getting credited for their rewards.\\nWhat I Like About Swagbucks You don’t see a lot issues with people not getting paid. Multiple ways to earn. No minimum payout. The ratio of good to bad Swagbucks reviews makes it clear that this is one of the more credible reward and survey sites you can join.\\nWhat I Don’t Like Aside from starting a Swagbucks referral business… there is no passive income potential. Each task only pays you once. The pay is low. It’s not suited for people who want to change their life, or replace their job income. Surveys often require you to share personal information.\\nWhere Do You Go From Here? In my opinion, making money doing small tasks and surveys is not the best use of your time. But that’s just me.\\nIf you\\'ve never made money online before, Swagbucks is a legitimate way you can get started. It’s also simple and fun and as I mentioned earlier, it\\'s great for someone to earn their first dollar (or two) online.\\nCombine it with other online survey sites like Survey Junkie and you\\'ll have plenty of online tasks you can do to make a little extra money each month.\\nIf a full-time income is something you need though because of a medical issue that makes it difficult to work, a young one at home who needs you, or even just a job you hate...\\n... an online business is what you want . Knowing how (and where) to get started is what you need in order to get what you want .\\nNow, I\\'m going to give you a free step by step beginner\\'s guide to making money online and you can get it by clicking HERE .\\nThanks for stopping by and reading… I hope my Swagbucks Review was helpful and if you have any comments or questions, or experience with Swagbucks, please share in the comments section below.\\nThe post Swagbucks Review 2019 – A SCAM or Legit Way To GET PAID Online? appeared first on Gig Hustlers .',\n",

       "   'text': 'By Kiley Thompson in Dorm Life , Frugal Students\\nIt’s the summer before your freshman year of college. Need some dorm room ideas? You’re moving into a small room in a few weeks that will become your new “home away from home,” and you’re going to need some stuff. You’re probably being inundated with package offers to outfit your room with matching comforters and rugs and USB night tables and fancy wall decor.\\nBut here’s the big secret: You can find a lot of what you need for your dorm room pretty cheaply. With some careful planning, and a good list and organization, you don’t have to break the bank to have a functional yet stylish dorm room, no matter what Pinterest tells you. And this goes for women AND men!\\nRELATED: 10 Things to Bring to Move-In, and Then Leave Behind Find Sales Before Back-to-School Time\\nAround mid-June, a lot of big box stores like Target and Wal-Mart are getting rid of things they deem “school supplies” before they start setting up their big back-to-school sections in July and August. Look in the clearance items for sheets or blankets too. Additionally, you can get individual pieces of cutlery at these stores, instead of buying a full set.\\nOther “constant coupon” stores like Kohl’s have big discounts on the every-popular Twin XL mattress pad, sheets, and towels almost constantly. Do some compare/contrast online against Amazon and other retailers too. Their online selection is much bigger than in-store. Second Hand Saves Money\\nCraigslist , LetGo , and even good old eBay (local) can have great deals, especially on bigger ticket items like minifridges and microwaves. It’s easier than going to yard and garage sales, and you can do it from the comfort of your computer or phone.\\nHere’s an insider tip from someone who lives in a college town: College town Craigslists can be jam packed with items graduates and other students are trying to get rid of. Look for the closest Craigslist for your college town, and see if you can pick something up around move-in time. That’ll also save you from moving it with the rest of your stuff! Goodwill or The Salvation Army: Huge Stockpiles of Stuff\\nAlong those same lines, Goodwill, Salvation Army, and other charity shops can have great deals. They usually have a variety of items, from plates to furniture. And the same college town tip applies. Research what donation-type stores are local to your dorm. You might end up with a serious deal.\\nFinally, be sure and text your new roommate often as you find stuff. We’re not saying things have to match, but there’s no need for you both to bring the fridge. Coordinate and communicate!\\nWhat are your best frugal dorm room ideas? Tweet or FB us!',\n",

A 12 pack of 20oz bottles is only $8 on amazon. And powerade is even cheaper at 24 20oz bottles for $12 but for some reason I don\\'t like the tase as much.\\nBasically these sports drinks are salt, sugar and electrolytes to keep you hydrated.

       "   'text': 'Alarming headlines regarding the climate crisis often overshadow positive actions taken by citizens around the world, but that doesn’t mean they’re not happening.\\nThey are, and sometimes with considerable success. DW looks at some civil society victories. I. Blocking fossil fuels\\nDespite scientific warnings, governments and companies continue to green light fossil fuel projects around the world. But in many instances, these authorizations are accompanied by protests. 1. Hema thermal power plant\\nEarlier this year, after more than a decade of vocal opposition to the planned Hema thermal power plant, villagers in the coastal Turkish region of Amasra welcomed a court ruling that rejected its construction. Locals had not only feared the destruction of their land, but also the impacts on their health and that of their children.\\nThe win is a milestone for Turkish climate activists, whose struggle to stop the expansion of fossil fuel plants in the country still has a long way to go. 2. Rocky Hill open-cut mine\\nLocals around the Australian town of Gloucester experienced similar satisfaction when a national court rejected a plan to build the Rocky Hill open-cut coal mine on the basis that it would increase greenhouse gas emissions at a time when they needed to be reduced. It took those involved in fighting the plans about a decade to achieve success.\\nThe judge said the negative impacts outweighed its economic and public benefits. Australia is the fourth largest coal producer in the world. 3. Hambach Forest\\nGermany has become the setting for one of the most iconic fights against coal mining in Europe.\\nHundreds of people have spent five years living in tree houses in a bit to prevent a tiny fraction of the Hambach forest in North Rhine-Westphalia from being razed for the expansion of a nearby open-pit coal mine that has already devoured dozens of villages and 90% of the forest.\\nIn 2018, the anti-coal movement brought together thousands of people in Germany’s biggest climate march. A few months later, authorities agreed on a moratorium on logging. Only until 2020, however, so theirs is a bittersweet victory. 4. Divesting money\\nMore and more people are demanding that investors, such as faith-based organizations and pension funds, withdraw their financial support from fossil fuel projects. The global divestment movement has convinced over 1,000 institutions to commit to divesting from oil, coal and gas companies. This translates to almost $8 trillion (€7 trillion) less in assets from fossil fuel investments.\\n“The momentum has been driven by a people-powered grassroots movement, ordinary people on every continent pushing their local institutions to take a stand against the fossil fuel industry and for a world powered by 100% renewable energy,” the NGO 350.org says. II. Thousands coming together\\nClimate protests have long been a niche for dedicated eco warriors, but this year, they’ve become increasingly mainstream. 1. Fridays for Future\\nKids who go on strike to protect their future are becoming the new normal. The Fridays for Future movement has managed to capture everyone’s attention — in a way that not even the iconic images of starving polar bears achieved.\\nIt all began with Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg skipping school on Fridays to take a lone stand outside her country’s parliament. That singular action has since spurred hundreds of thousands of young people worldwide to participate in Friday school strikes calling for decisive climate action. 2. Extinction Rebellion\\nIn early 2019, a mass civil disobedience campaign emerged on the streets of London. The protest group, which includes members of all ages and walks of life, occupied iconic sites in the English capital and saw some of its number strip off inside parliament.\\nA week of disruptive actions in April led to the arrest of more than 1,000 people, but it also scored the group considerable global attention. The movement has since expanded to more than 30 countries. 3. We Are Still In\\nUS President Donald Trump’s intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement came as a shock, but US American civil society quickly recovered. They gathered strength and created the We Are Still In coalition.\\nSince then, the group has tripled in size and now totals over 3,500 institutions, including local governments, faith communities, businesses and universities.\\nThe group has generated hundreds of climate commitments, businesses have pledged to meet climate targets and over 100 US cities have committed to switching to 100% percent renewable energy. III. The climate crisis goes to court\\nGlobally, more than a thousand court cases are demanding governments and polluters comply with laws to protect citizens. Some have already achieved success. 1. The Urgenda case\\nIn 2015, a group of Dutch citizens decided to hold their government accountable for contributing to climate change.\\nIn a landmark ruling, a court in the Hague ordered the Netherlands government to cut greenhouse-gas emissions in the country by at least 25% within five years. However, the Dutch government appealed the decision and a final decision is now expected from the Netherlands’ Supreme Court.\\nWhatever happens, the Urgenda case is seen by many as the climate’s greatest legal milestone. It has inspired lawsuits across the world.. 2. Waorani against oil\\nEarlier this year, Ecuador’s Waorani indigenous people celebrated a court ruling that suspends the sale of the community’s territory in the remote Amazon for the pursuit of oil extraction. The result came after more than five years of opposition from the indigenous group.\\nThis victory could also mark a turning point for other indigenous communities struggling to defend their land rights and oppose oil exploration.',\n",

I went ahead and found a dvd and ripped it (man I haven't done that in a while).\\nFile structure\\nHide contents\\nThen I went ahead and shared the tidbits on my network with an NFS server, similar to your NAS I would assume, its good enough for testing anyway.\\nHide contents\\nThen I went out to download and install the newest version of kodi in windows (running on a different machine). I'm sure a Linux or embedded version would work just the same.\\nHide contents\\nI then went ahead and added the NFS server to my... 'locations list?' I have no idea what its called.\\nHide contents\\nThen I added this location as a movie source, and apparently USB plug'n'play works in kodi too.\\nHide contents\\nFrom there, chose the type of media in the folder and junk, yeah limited vocabulary (sleep deprivation). You can pick your 'info scrapper' here too.\\nHide contents\\nAnd wabam, bobs your uncle twice removed.\\nHide contents\\nAfter a little bit of option browsing, you can list your stuff as 'tiles'\\nHide contents\\nHere's the best part, it plays, with the menu, and extra features, and lasers and monkeys.\\nHide contents\\nI really urge you to play around with this, I think its exactly what ya need. A VESA mount PC would be the way to go, Linux or Windows. I would shy away from the pi unless your on a budget (my pepperoni opinion*).\\nThanks for the testing info. Looking at the pi, the kit is around $55 to $80 depending on the kit from Amazon ( https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Premium-Clear-Supply/dp/B07BC7BMHY/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3U1NVBPP2F1ZY&keywords=raspberry+pi+3+b%2B+kit&qid=1560541400&s=gateway&sprefix=raspberry+pi+3+b%2B+%2Caps%2C658&sr=8-3 ) and the remote around $10 to $15 at ( https://www.gearbest.com/air-mouse/pp_009129563193.html?wid=1433363&currency=USD&vip=760153&gclid=Cj0KCQjwi43oBRDBARIsAExSRQFRtLxPybJf_7JCFHPq3x6cT2KuWghbVKL2g3x1ciNqm3YnfUL_RQwaAjfKEALw_wcB )\\nSo looking at around $70 for the pi x 2 (for 2 rooms) it'll be around $140 vs. around $150 for 1. Since I have to make 2, I was hoping to use the Boxee Box's hardware I have, but if I have to build/create a new one for each, I was hoping that they wouldn't be in the $100+ to almost $200 range for each one.\",\n",

       "   'text': 'REVOLUTION PRO SUPREME EYESHADOW PALETTE IN ALLURE: The Allure eyeshadow palette by the REVOLUTION PRO is one of my favourite eyeshadow palette. Priced at INR 995/- its a really good eyeshadow palette. You can easily create a nice day to night time smokey eye looks in the colour family of browns, purples, blues and black depending on what technique you are using. The only problem I have with this eyeshadow palette is that its very powdery and because of that there will be loads of fall out. That is why I would advice that one does their eye makeup first and then followed by base rather than base first because of the fall out.\\nWHERE TO BUY? This palette is easily available on Nykaa , Amazon India and Hokmakeup website in India and at NewU and Nykaa shops all across India. And great thing is that this palette is on sale most of the time so you can definitely check your luck.\\nTUTORIAL VIDEO: PRODUCT INFO: Revolution Pro Supreme Eyeshadow Palette in Allure\\nNykaa Eyebrow Pencil in Bewitched Chestnut\\nLA Girl Eyebrow Setting Gel\\nLA Girl Concealer in Natural\\nNykaa M Bold Kajal Eyeliner\\nBenefit Cosmetics Badgal Mascara\\nHouse Of Lashes in style Heartbreaker (not available in India)\\nNYX Professional Makeup Faux Whites Eye Brightener – Vanilla\\nNYX Soft Matte Lip Cream in shade TOULOUSE\\nWISESHE Set Of Pro Eyeshadow and Face brushes\\nOVERALL REVIEW: The REVOLUTION PRO Supreme Eyeshadow Palette in Allure is one of my favourite for creating nice shimmery eye makeup looks. I would advice that you watch my tutorial video which is displayed above, where I showed how to exactly use this palette to achieve its full potential. My favourite technique for using shimmery/glitter shades is to use some kind of black base underneath it. My favourite black base is the mBold Creamy Black Kajal by Nykaa Beauty brand.\\n(You can use any kind of creamy kajal/eyeliner as a base).\\nThis way the shades mix and match. And you end up creating your own different unique shade. I paired this blue smokey eye look with a pink-ish nude-ish lipstick shade called TOULOUSE by NYX Cosmetics from their Soft Matte Lip Cream range.\\nx o,\\nBharti Puri\\nThe post REVOLUTION PRO SUPREME EYESHADOW IN ALLURE appeared first on Bharti Puri .\\n',\n",

       "   'text': \"\\nTorturous. Islamic supremacist in action. There are noise ordinances but not for religion of peaceniks. Special rights for a special class. Video: Brooklyn New York Mosque Broadcasts Islamic Call to Prayer to 20 Block Radius\\n“I am in downtown Brooklyn, but I swear it’s Saudi Arabia”.\\nBy: Paul Joseph Watson, June 14, 2019:\\nA resident of Brooklyn posted a Facebook live video documenting how the Islamic call to prayer was being broadcast to a 20 block radius by a local mosque. “I am in downtown Brooklyn, but I swear it’s Saudi Arabia, y’all hear that?” asks Derrick Gibson as the words “No God but Allah, Mohammad is his messenger” are broadcast. “What the hell disturbing the peace! You gotta love it right here in America – this not Saudi Arabia” states Gibson as the noise gets louder. The mosque in question is the Masjid-Al-Aman. A previous report from 2016 documents how locals complained 156 times about the call to prayer, labeling it a nuisance. The commentary on the clip claims that the broadcast is a violation of New York City noise control ordinance. However, according to a resident, when she contacted police about the noise, she was told, ”You can report excessive noise coming from a house of worship when a service is not being held as the police WILL NOT respond if you are reporting noise during a religious service.” Police told her that it was perfectly legal to broadcast the sound using speakers during a religious service.

I don’t want to start a politics debate or anything, but big retailers do have leverages that small retailers don’t, either through mass volume sales, aggressively negotiating prices with suppliers, or cutting out distributors and using their own distribution. The reason small stores often have the same goods as large big-box retailers for twice the cost isn’t necessarily greed on the part of the small retailers.',\n",

       "   'text': 'June 15,\\nIn December 2016, I took an affiliate marketing course. Even though I’d been doing affiliate marketing since 2008, I took it because I was astounded that the developer/teacher was still in her 20s. And …\\nShe had managed to start a blog that earns over $100,000 — per MONTH — consistently .\\nYeah, you read that right; it’s not a typo.\\nNote: How Did You Get Your First Affiliate Sale?\\nInitially, I asked 10 affiliate marketers to share how they got their first affiliate sale and how long it took. That made up the first 10 contributions, which were first published in Feb 2017. THEN, because …\\nI had so much fun putting this post together (and learning some things) that I decided to make it an “evergreen” post; adding to it over time. Click here to share your story — and drive traffic to your site/blog. My Affiliate Marketing Earnings\\nAs stated above, I’ve been doing affiliate marketing for years and although I’ve had some good days — $100, $200, $300 and even a $900 day — I could scarcely wrap my brain around the figures she was earning.\\nSo I said to myself, “ If she can earn over $100,000 per month as an affiliate marketer , I need to know what’s she’s doing! ” Without hesitation (after some research), I bought her course.\\nAs an aside, I’m not one of those people who buys any and every thing that comes down the pike. I’ve bought enough online products that DIDN’T work that it takes a lot for me to shell out money.\\nI’m pretty good at figuring out stuff, but the more I researched Michelle, the more impressed I was by her and her course. And I wasn’t disappointed. I learned a ton. The Pinterest strategy alone was worth the price of the course in my opinion.\\nAlso, she has a private, affiliate mastermind Facebook group that is chock full of information from the over 1,300 participants there (as of this writing).\\nThis was a bonus I didn’t even realize came with the course that’s been worth its weight in gold. It was to this group that I posted the following message about a week ago. I wrote:\\nI want to do an “inspirational” post to help newbies see that affiliate marketing is a long-range game plan, not a “get rich quick” scheme.\\nLooking for those willing to share how long it took to get the first affiliate sale and a bit of insight into how you did it. Of course, your name and your website/blog link will be included. You can share it here, or email me.\\nFollowing are the responses I received, along with my contribution. And FYI, if you like this post, please share it on Pinterest. It’s where I get a lot of my site traffic, and you can too by sharing info like this. 10 35 Affiliate Marketers Recall How They Got Their First Sale 1. BecomingWellThy.com , by blogger Lauren Wittry\\nHi Yuwanda!\\nI started my blog last year, with my first “real” launch in September [2016]. I made my first affiliate sale that month – $13.51 through Share A Sale.\\nI have been documenting my progress ever since, and you can tell it’s progressive but slow moving. And I am ok with that, I know it takes time!\\nThis month I had my biggest affiliate month to date – $301.72! Post about it publishing tomorrow.\\nI used Michelle’s class and another course, but my real advice would be to look for every opportunity in your niche, don’t be super sell-y and gain trust in your readers!\\nAnd always look for ways to add links to your posts. 2. TheFlooringGirl.com , by blogger Debbie Gartner\\nI originally started my blog for my flooring business 5.5 years ago. I built it over time, and it did very well.\\nI never even thought about monetizing it until I reached the 4.5 yr mark. That’s when I first heard about the concept.\\nI started with Amazon. I recommended complementary products to my hardwood flooring business (e.g. hardwood floor cleaners, felt pads, etc.).\\nBecause I already had a lot of traffic, I earned $100 my first month (January 2016). I was thrilled.\\nThen, it gradually grew month by month. But, it was gradual and I was hoping it would accelerate much faster. The highest I was getting was a bit over $300.\\nThen, Thanksgiving weekend, I made a shift. I added some ads and I then started to write some more articles and articles that were more geared to affiliate products. In December 2016, I earned a bit over $1,100. In January 2017, it was almost $1,500; and Feb 2017 (a shorter month), should be between $1,300-$1,400. 3. Crowdworknews.com , by blogger Sireesha Narumanchi\\nHello Yuwanda,\\nThanks for the opportunity to contribute.\\nI made my first affiliate income in the third month of blogging and most of it was from affiliate marketing. Though the amount was small ($310), I learnt a lot from it.\\nOne thing that I learned was promotion is the biggest part of monetizing especially for affiliate marketin g. Promotion and networking were the biggest reasons for my first affiliate income. Whether it is from affiliates, ads or any other ways, making money from blog takes time and requires a lot of testing and implementing strategies.\\nThanks again, 4. LiveFrugaLee.com , by blogger Danny Lee\\nHi Yuwanda,\\nHere is my contribution for your post:\\nIt took me about 3 months to get my first affiliate sale. I had started with a free wordpress blog (livefrugalee.wordpress.com), but I decided I wanted to get a self-hosted site to look more professional and to take wordpress out of my domain name .\\nI wrote a post about it after I finally made the move, and someone who was contemplating the same thing asked me about my decision. I explained why I opted for self-hosting, shared my experience with bluehost , and offered an affiliate link.\\nA few days later, he used my affiliate link to sign up. That was my first affiliate conversion. I also wrote a post about my experiences driving for Uber and Lyft as a side hustle, and provided detailed information about my earnings.\\nI got a good amount of organic traffic, and a guy emailed me about the current Lyft referral bonus at the time, which was $750 for him and $1000 for me if he completed a certain number of rides within 30 days.\\nA 4-Figure Affiliate Commission!\\nI tried to be as helpful and informative as I could, and he ended up signing up and getting the bonus. That was my first 4-figure ($1,000) affiliate sale.\\nThanks! 5. BreakingTheOnePercent.com , by blogger Jeff Proctor\\nHi Yuwanda!\\nI saw your post in Michelle’s group and thought I would shoot you an email.\\nI’ve been blogging for about two years, but I didn’t start actively pursuing affiliate marketing until about 6 months ago. Since I already knew a lot of the basics of blogging, my results are likely better than someone brand new- I’ve gone from $0 in affiliate income to over $7,000 per month in 6 months .\\nMy two biggest pieces of advice to new affiliate marketers would be: You Won’t Get Anywhere Without Traffic: I would aim for at least 10,000 monthly page views per month before focusing on monetizing your audience . Until you reach that point, traffic needs to be your top priority! To Get More Traffic, Focus Exclusively on Mastering ONE Social Media : When I tried to be everywhere all at once, I wasn’t getting anywhere. It wasn’t until I went all-in on Pinterest and focused 100% on “figuring it out” that I started to generate high volume traffic from social media.\\nThe last thing I would say to new affiliate marketers is that self awareness is SO important. It’s easy to get caught in the routine of doing what you think is working, when it’s actually not working.\\nAlways be looking at what others are doing in your niche; always be re-evaluating your game plan; and always be thinking about new ways to hit your audience.\\nI hope this works. Thanks for the opportunity! 6. LadiesMakeMoney.com , by blogger Divine Mwimba\\nI took a course on affiliate marketing back in April of 2016. I did a lot of research and educating.\\nI then started a new blog Ladies Make Money Online in November of 2017 as a way to teach other ladies how to make money online. My first affiliate sale was in December of 2016. They are still not huge. Only $86. 7. CarrieWillard.com , by blogger Carrie Willard\\nMy story!\\n14 years ago, I was blogging a little and doing direct sales offline. I decided to host a “business moms expo” in my community to showcase my business as well as make a little money inviting other people to participate. It was a smashing success and I hosted another.\\nTo save time on the second expo, since I was inundated with emails and phone calls before and after the first event, I created a 3-page website to answer questions from participants and attendees.\\nI knew people made money from affiliate marketing, so I threw a couple of links on that site on a “resources” page – things I knew would appeal to people in direct sales or who were looking for a business opportunity to start from home.\\nLo and behold, after the expo was over, I logged in and discovered that I had made some money from those links! I had almost forgotten about them. It was a life-changing moment. I went on to create a few websites that made money from affiliate products. At one point I was supporting my family as a single mom. 8. EdenFried.com , by blogger Eden Fried\\nHi Yuwanda,\\nGreat to connect with you 🙂 I’d LOVE to contribute to your post if you’re still accepting people!!\\nLet me know if you need anything else from me. I also would love to share this on social media when it’s live!\\nIt took me about 3 months to make my first affiliate sale. I remember the day and time exactly… it felt like pure joy!\\nA lot of people say that affiliate marketing is too hard and too competitive but, despite those ramblings, I went for it anyway and I’m so glad I did. Those first 90 days were tough and filled with grunt work.\\nI spent much of my time curating quality content and promoting it on social media.\\nHonestly, I still spend a lot of time doing those tough tasks, but now I’ve built a strong foundation and the sales are coming in consistently.\\nThese days, I make around $500 in passive affiliate sales each month, in addition to my other blog revenue! I can’t complain. The long haul was worth it. 9. FITnancials.com , by blogger Alexis Schroeder\\nIt took 2 days for me to get my first affiliate sale , although my first sale was through Amazon , which is probably the easiest way to get into affiliate marketing for a blog at any level.\\nIt came naturally as I was talking about products I love and simply included a link with what I was talking about. 10. InkwellEditorial.com, by blogger Yuwanda Black\\nMy first affiliate sale was somewhat of a family affair and it only took a few days at most. It was in December 2008. One of my sisters wrote a book on foreclosure cleaning .\\nIf you remember, foreclosures were big in the news from 2007 to about 2011/2012. The collapse of the financial — and hence, housing — industry flooded the market with foreclosures.\\nMy sister started a business cleaning foreclosures in the Atlanta area. Because she still had a full-time job when she first started and I worked from home, I agreed to answer the phone for her. Well lo and behold, she was getting so many calls — many of them about how to start this type of business.\\nI told her to write a book and self-publish it. I’d been doing self-publishing since 2002 and knew that it would be a big seller based on the calls I was getting. After some hemming and hawing, she finally wrote the book and allowed me to be an affiliate for it.\\nI was her only affiliate — and made my first sale from her ebook.\\nHow I Did It\\nI sold the book in several ways, eg:\\nArticle Marketing: Back then, this was a huge form of marketing, especially from an SEO perspective. Nowadays article marketing is not advised, especially for search engine optimization purposes, but you know what is? Guest posting.\\nIt’s all content marketing, but guest posting is the newfangled version of article marketing.\\nCreated a minisite: I created a website just for my sister’s ebooks and drove traffic to it from my article marketing efforts.\\nPublished a blog: I blogged about foreclosures in general, and put my sister’s ebooks (she went on to write several others in that niche) on it.\\nOver the years, I’ve earned tens of thousands of dollars off of my sister’s products. We even co-authored one book together on the subject. And to this day, I still earn from her products.\\nIn fact, as of this update today (3/13/2019), I’ve earned almost $100 in affiliate commissions from her product line. That’s over a decade later in case you missed it.\\nThis has been my most successful affiliate relationship to date. As you can see, I went “all in” with it — ie, creating websites and blogs and writing articles on/about it.\\nThe lesson: If you find a “hot product,” market the heck out of it!\\nI have several streams of income — freelance writing; self-publishing; ecourse development and affiliate marketing. My overall goal is to get a cache of 8 or 10 products that sell well like this, and to earn $10,000 per month — just in affiliate income.\\nThat is why I took Michelle’s course . I knew that if I wanted to increase my affiliate earnings substantially, I needed to do something drastic. And when I saw her success, I said to myself, “ If she can earn over $100,000 per month, surely I can do a tenth of that. ”\\nRight now, I’m focused not so much on sales, but on building site traffic and getting all the behind-the-scenes stuff done like finding some “bread and butter,” evergreen affiliate products to promote, writing tutorials, getting Pinterest on auto pilot, and getting on a predictable blogging schedule.\\nAfter all of this is done, then I’ll monetize the traffic. The main goal is to get enough to join an ad network like Mediavine. So I need a consistent 25K page views per month or more for this. Right now, I hit it that mark, but it’s not consistent.

TheSheApproach.com , by blogger Ana\\nI ran across Ana’s post when I went on a search for more bloggers to contribute to this post.\\nI emailed her asking to contribute, and she wrote back telling me to “ Feel free to extract any bits of my blog post about it .” So that’s just what I did, as Ana had answered the questions I posed in her post.\\nOn how long it took her to get that first sale — how about less than 2 days . She wrote: “Did it take 24 hours to make my affiliate sale? No. It took about 30 [hours].” The sale was of the ebook, How to Make Your First Affiliate Sale in 24 Hours Using Pinterest .\\nAs stated above, it took her 30 hours to make her first sale, and she did it by “devouring the ebook; taking three pages worth of notes, creating her own Pinterest strategy and implementing it right away.”\\nPublisher Note: Thanks Ana for letting me share your story here.\\nFYI, one of the things I loved the most about the Making Sense of Affiliate Marketing e-course is the Pinterest strategy, as I discuss in my review . It really, really does work, as Ana’s success underscores. 12. QCBlogger.com , by blogger Al Mamun\\n“I made my first affiliate sale after 363 days of blogging.” My thought when I read that quote from Al’s blog was, “Wow, talk about persistence!” This is EXACTLY why I wanted to write this post — to show that persistence and hard work does pay off.\\nIn the linked-to post, Al details how he started his first blog in 2012. When that one didn’t go so well (he choice of niche didn’t pan out), he started another one in 2015. Within a few months of starting that, a family illness caused him to have to cease blogging for 6 months.\\nWhen that crisis ended, he started blogging again — and that’s why it took him almost a year to make his first affiliate sale, which was for a WordPress theme that he did a review for. His review landed in some top spots on Google and Bing.\\nFYI, that’s the power of knowing how to write properly SEO’d (search engine-optimized) content . 13. ThePeachyRose.com , by blogger Dr. Kaitlyn Rose\\nDr. Rose (PhD in pharmacy) had been blogging for two months before she got her first sale . She was about to give up when a sale came through — for a product she’d only been promoting for about 12 hours! By way of explanation, she wrote: I started to see my hard work pay off in my second month of blogging when my [site] traffic started doubling in numbers. … but the unfortunate part was I still was not making any money.”\\nDr. Rose wrote that she was about to give on in frustration, then, fortuitously, she ran across a pin that blared, “ How To Make Your First Affiliate Sale in 24 Hours Using Pinterest .” She clicked it out of curiosity, then found out what the “catch” was.\\nThe link was to a purchase page for a book by that name. Not wanting to make the purchase — after all ,she’s been blogging for a couple of months, but still hadn’t made any money, she thought to herself “How’s this possible?”\\nObviously intrigued, she made the purchase (the book was only $25), and following is what happened.\\n… when I saw that the ebook was only listed for $25, I thought the price was reasonable. “I purchased the ebook at 12:50 AM and my first transaction went through at 12:28 PM. (Barely less than 12 hours, but, hey, it counts!)”\\nWhat struck me about Dr. Rose’s experience was how affiliate marketing attracts everyone — from those with no degrees (but with strong work ethics), to those who are fully degreed (and pedigreed), but who want to do their own thing.\\nDr. Rose stated in that post that her mission was to earn what she earned as a pharmacist in a year — in one month in affiliate marketing/blogging. 14. TheDeadbeatStudent.com , by blogger Robert Piercy\\nPastor Robert (yes, he’s a youth pastor in Arkansas), a total newbie to affiliate marketing until early 2017, got his first affiliate sale just over a month after starting . Using Dan Brock’s Deadbeat Super Affiliate system, Robert is investing his time building niche sites. He explains, writing: I just made my first affiliate commission sale! … So I’m a little over a month into my affiliate empire building. … Right out of the gate I built 5 affiliate niche websites. … It’s been kinda tough getting that site to rank high enough to get Google traffic, but … After that, through talking with Dan, and through the direct access I get with Deadbeat University, I built 4 different sites around things that I like or am interested in.\\nSo Robert’s on his way. He’s actively blogging about his journey, giving readers an blow-by-blow account of what he’s doing that’s working — and not working. A Surefire Way to Make Money with Niche Blogs & Websites\\nFYI, building an authority niche blog is a great way to make money in affiliate marketing. One of the best ways to learn how to do this is via Authority Hacker .\\nThe creators of the site founded a highly successful digital marketing (SEO) agency in 2011, serving well-known clients like Macy’s, Tripadvisor, Atari and Evite.\\nThey know what works online, and what doesn’t. They put that knowledge to use to build their own niche sites, giving you a front-row seat as they do so via in-depth case studies (like the one featured in the graphic here) that show you what’s working, why and how you can apply these principles to your own site. 15. Joleisa.com , by twin sister bloggers Jo and Leisa\\nIt took these sisters a year to earn their first affiliate sale. Their earnings? $196.00 from selling an Elite Blog Academy course. As one described it: “I literally screamed so loud that I shocked even myself! … It is hard to describe the feeling one gets when one makes the first money from blogging. … I have felt that feeling several times since then, but nothing compares to the first time when I actually did make some money from my blog. And this sale came less than one year after starting my blog!”\\nAfter giving up and feeling that it wasn’t possible to make money blogging, they hung in there. Learn more about how they landed that first affiliate sale here . A Note about Promoting Ecourses\\nThe sisters wrote of promoting courses as an affiliate : Deciding to become an affiliate for the course I was doing was a no-brainer for me. It meant that I didn’t have to spend the time making up a course, but I could actually advertise other peoples’ courses on my site and make a profit doing so.\\nAs a course developer and promoter, I can say that on the face of of it, promoting can be easier than developing one. The upside of development though, is that once it’s done, have to do is keep it updated and it can earn you money for years. That’s the case with my SEO copywriter training course , which I’ve been teaching (and earning from) since 2009.\\nCourse development is a natural off-shoot of my freelance writing business, and happens to be something I enjoy immensely. So give it a shot if you haven’t tried it before “writing it off” (pun fully intended). 🙂\\nEarn Almost $150 per Sale!\\nHere are the affiliate details on one of my courses . Feel free to contact me with an questions, interview requests, podcast requests, etc. I’m here to help your promotional efforts in any way I can. 16. Meetahmad.com , by blogger Muhammad Ahmad\\nIn January 2016, Muhammad tried affiliate marketing for the first time. And what do you know, he made his first affiliate sale that month — earning $27. How did he do it? By promoting a Udemy course using Facebook ads. After setting up his Facebook ads campaign, Muhammad wrote: I went sleep and had a couple of bloggy dreams. 🙂 I woke up and got excited to see five sales in the analytics! Still the campaign was running, and I started hoping for better results… Udemy offered 10% commission per sale, so I made sales of 270$ to make 27$.\\nFacebook ads can be very cheap to run and extremely effective. I used them to promote my line of romance ebooks and saw steady sales. Until …\\nGetting Your Facebook Ad Account Suspended\\nBe careful though — because you can get your account banned from “boosting” posts (ie, paying for ads). It happened to me. After a year and a half, I’ve recently petitioned them again to lift my suspension. It’s been about three days, still haven’t heard anything — just wanted to put that warning out there. 17. ChantelArnett.com , by blogger Chantel Arnett\\nPublisher Note: Chantel was one of the original bloggers (of the group of 10) who had responded to my request for contributors. I inadvertently overlooked her (very helpful!) contribution, so here it is now. She wrote:\\nHi, Yuwanda!\\nHere is my submission for your round-up blog post. Thanks for including me. 🙂\\nIt didn’t take long at all [2 months] to get my first affiliate sale once I promoted a product, but…\\nI did a lot of things to be ready for that first “promotion”. Before I ever even considered promoting an affiliate product, I started a blog, started a Facebook group, started growing an email list, learned about ways to monetize a blog and about affiliate marketing in particular.\\nMore importantly, I committed myself to engaging authentically with others. My goal was not to make money, it was to be of service to others. I answered questions in other Facebook groups, not just my own. On many occasions, I even researched on my own to find answers when I didn’t already know them.\\nOnly after I had done all of these things did I feel comfortable promoting a product as an affiliate. At that point, I felt like I had a good understanding of what types of products my audience would be genuinely interested in and that I could recommend a product without appearing spammy or salesy.\\nAll of that to say, this is what the timeline looked liked for me personally: Spring of 2016 – started my first blog. Summer of 2016 – started my Facebook group “Blogging with a Smile.” Fall of 2016 – changed my blog niche. September 2016 – posted the first blog post on my new blog chantelarnett.com . November 2016 – made my first affiliate sale in November when I emailed my list to tell them about SiteGround’s Black Friday sale.\\nMaking money as an affiliate marketer is not a get-rich-quick scheme. But it can be a rewarding way to monetize your blog if you know your audience, understand their interests and needs, and develop a relationship with them by engaging in meaningful ways. 18. TwinsMommy.com , by blogger Elna Cain\\nIt took freelance writer — and mom to twins — Elna Cain, just four months to start making money in affiliate marketing from her blog. She wrote: I started this blog a year ago, and within four months of starting, I was making money . But, it wasn’t a lot (around $20). But that didn’t matter! I did it! I made an income with my blog, and I was happy with that. For the next couple of months, I made some money, but it never topped over $50.\\nEven though her earnings weren’t that much, it fired Elna up to put together a legitimate strategy for making money with affiliate marketing from her blog. Once she did this, she saw an almost immediate increase in income — earning $200 a month after solidifying her plan. 19. HodgePodgeHippie.com , by blogger Thena Reading-Franssen\\nIt took this frugal family/mom blogger a couple of months to earn her first commission. She started blogging in March, and had her first earnings in May.\\nBefore I tell you what it was, let me back up a minute. I encountered Thena’s hilarious post in the Making Sense of Affiliate Marketing Facebook group.\\nFYI, this is the BEST thing about the course by the way. The help from other bloggers– and brutally honest accounts like Thena’s of what it takes to really make money blogging make it an invaluable resource. But, I digress. Back to Thena’s story.\\nThena earned an astounding — drum roll — 25 cents in May from her blog via Shareaholic. Hey, it counts; it’s earnings! As she hilariously states in her brilliant post: For the month of May 2017, I made .25 cents! 🙂 I had no expenses, except for my time and sanity, and am hoping to double my income for June. (.50 cents in my goal!! :-))\\nBut is she discouraged by her “blue gumball-buying” profits? No, quite the opposite, which is why I know she will be successful one day. She writes that “ although it is her ultimate goal to end all other “side hustles”, and be able to focus full-time on her blog, she knows it isn’t an overnight “magic” that just happens. ”\\nLesson: if you know going in the work that it’s going to take, that’s half the battle right there.\\nI’d wager to say, it’s 90% of the battle because you won’t be so easily discouraged, you realize it’s a marathon not a sprint; you’ll bounce back easier from setbacks, and will be more patient waiting on those big wins to roll in.\\nEarn four times what Thena earned with just one click. One of the first affiliate marketing programs I signed up with that I saw immediate results from was ShareaSale .\\nThat’s because you can earn in two ways with them — on specific products you promote, and on leads you send their way ($1/lead). There are thousands of products and services across hundreds of niches you can start promoting right away. And, unlike a lot of affiliate marketing programs, they’re super easy to sign up with and get accepted. 20. SmartOnlineFortune.com , by blogger Miki Patel\\n“It took me about six months to make my first affiliate sale, and my first affiliate sale was worth about $35,” Miki says. This blogger went on to say, “I didn’t make my first dollar until I decided to invest in the “ Making Sense of Affiliate Marketing” course .\\nTaking an affiliate marketing course was the best decision I ever made because I had no idea how much money I was leaving on the table. This course taught me the exact strategies to make money with affiliate marketing.”\\nMarketing Techniques Used: I used affiliate links in every single blog post I wrote. I promoted these blog posts like crazy in Facebook groups, on Pinterest group boards, on Twitter, and in Google+ communities. I also started building an email list of subscribers and sent an email every time there was a sale for a product I loved.\\nPublisher Note: I can second the “using affiliate links in every post.” Nowadays, I always, always, always find some affiliate product(s) to link to in my posts. And as I touched on in this post , when you promote products that are pertinent to your niche, this is very easy to do naturally . And it works — beautifully.\\nThanks Miki for sharing your insight, and continued success. 21. Pinnicledrone.com , by blogger Jacob Findlay\\n“It took me 2 months to make my first sell. [sic]”\\nIt was for $1.49. I had to pay a few people to help me out. So I’m actually still in the negative but I’m hoping consistency is going to pay off. I focused mostly on social media because I knew my site wasn’t going to be ranked very high more then likely for awhile. It’s been fun overall. I try to stay active researching and adding posts at least a few times a week. 22. EnoughWork.com , by blogger Joseph Karanja\\n“I started my blog in December of 2016. However, It was not until May [2017] when I made my first sale.”\\nIt was just a minimal amount of about 13 dollars but it was, nevertheless, a great motivation to push on. I mainly got this sale by promoting by blog on social media platforms and especially Facebook groups that were close to my niche. 23. Wealthanize.com , by blogger Jason Shick\\nIt took about 2 months after setting up my affiliate program with somebody who doesn’t even have an affiliate program.\\nI had a blog post that was pulling in 4500 visitors a month to one post and there was a product I wanted to try but didn’t want to pay for it. So I contacted the site owners and they set up a rudimentary affiliate program where customers used a coupon code tied to my site to get a small discount. This let them track my sales.\\nIn return, they gave me the product to review (which was $300) with the agreement that each sale would be $100 to me, with the first 3 sales going toward paying for the program. It was about 2 months before we got our first sale and I’ve had more since then.\\nHow much earned on first affiliate sale? $100\\nMarketing Technique(s) Used: My post was about flipping land and the programs I used to learn wouldn’t contact me back about affiliate programs. So I found another lesser known and cheaper (but better quality) program and worked out an affiliate deal with them. 24.

After you reach a certain level of traffic, it’s much easier to monetize (eg, via ad networks like Mediavine, AdThrive, etc.).\\nOne of the Easiest, Fastest Ways to Grow Blog Traffic\\nOnce I started running cheap Facebook ads , my traffic started to grow more predictably.

Like any other business, affiliate marketing requires this kind of attention to detail.\\nGet Creative: A great example of this is blogger Jason Shick. He saw a post that was getting decent traffic and reached out to a company that didn’t even have an affiliate program and worked out a deal.\\nMoney: Just because you don’t have any, it doesn’t mean you can’t get started.\\nThis is especially true as a lot of what needs to be done to be successful only costs time, eg, writing posts, like blogger Curtis Smith did when he first started out.\\nTime: It needn’t take years to start earning really good money.\\nAs long as you have traffic (which is why this should dominate your efforts in the beginning of your affiliate marketing career; that and growing your subscriber list ), you can find a way to monetize it.\\nSEO: Writing great content is useless if no one can find it to read it. This means knowing how to write SEO content so that Google can return it in search results.

The small wins especially count because they are what keep you motivated.\\nIt’s rare — especially in the beginning — that you’ll get a big affiliate sale every day (or even a little one). But finally figuring out that plugin, or going from 30 to 75 page views per day on Pinterest — those are the small wins that lead to big wins down the line.\\nSo celebrate them with all the fervor you do the big wins and before long, you’ll be bringing in the big bucks — and marveling that you make a living doing something you love, from anywhere you please.\\nAnd FYI, I did it for 5 years full-time from Jamaica ! 🙂 P.S.: Like this post?

Other users could then react with ‘smiles’ and comments, the CNET reported on Friday.\\nEven as it was Instagram’s competitor, Spark was primarily focused on shopping and sale.\\nWhile it tried to mock the Instagram aesthetic at times with fashion inspiration images or highly posed travel photos, it lacked the photo sharing app’s broader appeal. Your friends weren’t there and there weren’t any Instagram Stories, for example. Everything felt too transactional, according to the TechCrunch.\\n“Amazon declined to comment on the apparent shutdown of Spark but the service is gone from the website and app,” the TechCrunch report added.

       "   'text': '|| Top || Shorts || Hair Pomade ||\\nAlright everyone!!! It is that time of the month! Our AMAZON FAVORITES!!! YESSS!!!\\nIf you have every wondered what bows Caroline wears in her hair, what self tanner I use on the daily (it is what I used to get my glowy bronze in the photo above), or how I make my hair look piecey a la Kristin Cavallari…you will absolutely LOVE this post! Shop Emily’s Amazon Favorites For May 2019: Emily’s Amazon Favorites For May 2019: BYRD: I have posted this product on our feed many times before and I am absolutely obsessed with it! Not only does it keep my postpartum hair loss baby hairs at bay, it also gives the end of my hair a nice piecey look. My husband discovered it by complete mistake when we were in Omaha for a wedding, and I am oh so thankful! I was having static issues one morning, decided to try it, and boom – I was hooked immediately! Water Pick: I hate flossing – so I decided I would try out a Waterpik and I am absolutely obsessed with it! This one is over 30% off right now, so it is the perfect time to make the switch. It makes your teeth look whiter, your mouth feel cleaner, and all around it just takes your oral hygiene to the next level! Flower Earrings: These earrings are SO similar to other $300 plus earrings that are out there right now – at a fraction of the cost! When I wore them on stories you all went SO crazy for them I could absolutely not believe it! They really are THAT cute though! Boxwood Set: This is the boxwood set I used to make the Boxwood Photo Wall for my sister’s Bridal Shower ! If you need the DIY post – it covers everything on how to do it, how much it costs, how we affixed it to the wall… etc… you can head to this post here ! Caroline’s Bows: These bows have been quite the hot topic on instagram. Everyone wants to know where I get them because they are just SO cute on little girls that might not have so much hair yet! What I really love about them is that they are so inexpensive – you don’t feel bad if you lose one or if one gets dirty! Glass Tupperware: When I posted about HOW BAD the mold on my strawberries always was – you all told me that I had to get glass tupperware, and I HAD to get these! So I did. I also started washing my berries in a vinegar bath every time I get them, and I also started chopping them up right when I get them as well. All I can say is, the combo works! Tanning Mousse: This tanning mousse is seriously the best self tanner in the whole wide world. I apply it with the St. Tropez mitt , and for $35 less than a normal tan- you can look like you just went on a tropical beach vacation! Imagination Magnets: This is one of our favorite activities to do with the kids lately! My dad got this amazing set for our kids for Christmas and they have been obsessed with it ever since. It teaches colors, shapes, and we love it because we can all do it together! It works best if you all decide on a design and then you ask your kids, “Ok.. now we need the purple square, now we need the yellow circle….” It makes the whole experience super interactive and fun! I really love this game for travel because it comes in this amazing and sturdy wooden box that makes transporting it easy and playing with it on a plane as simple as can be.',\n",

       "   'text': \"Mia Thomas just turned 15. On her special day, her teacher needs to speak with her parents, her father gets arrested and a stray cat starts talking to her. So much for a Happy Birthday!With the help from her new familiar, Gumshoe, Mia sets out to clear her family's name and save them from financial ruin. Will her snooping cause her own death or will her coffee-drinking, wise-cracking, booze- desiring familiar come to her rescue? BUY LINK Amazon Link : https://amzn.to/2KMRSC5 Excerpt Unsure of what else to do, Mia grabbed some tuna fish and a plate and headed out to the back. She set the plate down, then moved across the alleyway to sit on the stoop of the opposite building. “Poisonous mushrooms?” Mia talked to herself in disbelief. “I made the soup. I cut up the mushrooms and put them in the soup. Somehow this is my fault. I served them. What have I done?”“ You didn’t do anything. You didn’t pick them out, so this isn’t your fault.” The voice rang in her head, her ears heard faint meows. She looked up and around, trying to see who was talking to her. The only thing she saw was the Siamese cat she’d been feeding the past week. She shook her head to clear it of cobwebs she was sure were there. She watched the feline move towards the food she’d left for him. He sniffed it, but then skirted around it to go behind the dumpster. Odd, she thought at his bypassing the food. She watched the cat move around, almost searching for something, though she couldn’t imagine what. “Meow. Meow. Mew. Meep. Eep. Meoooow.” The Siamese sat regally on top of the dumpster, staring at her. However, she heard something more than just the sounds made from a feline creature. Wonderful. I turn fifteen and I get to go bonkers. I swear I heard him in my head and it actually made sense. I’m hallucinating, or so lit I’ve lost it. “ Darn it. I forgot you can’t understand me.” The cat seemed to grumble and jump off the dumpster, wandering down the alleyway. Mia rubbed her forehead. “This just can’t be possible. Cats don’t speak English.” The Siamese stopped and stared at her. “Meow, meep?” Mia heard, “Do you understand me, kitten?” She gasped, standing quickly and taking a step back only to trip on the stoop and fall back down on her rump. The cat moved cautiously closer to her. “Mew?” { How? } Mia shrugged in answer to the question, but covered her mouth to stop herself from screaming at the same time. She had no clue what was going on, but if she wasn’t totally crazy, she was understanding what this cat said to her. Great. Now I’m Doctor Doolittle, she thought to herself. “Zoe’s right. I’ve gone off the deep end and am Cray-Cray with a capital C.” The Siamese tilted his head, watching her with large, blue, unblinking eyes. “Meow, meow, mew, mew, meow, mew.” { If you really understand me, look behind the dumpster. }“I’m insane. I’m really in looneyland. I’m talking to myself and being answered by a cat that I can understand. This is so wrong on so many levels.” Breathlessly, cautiously, Mia stood and skirted around the small cat as if he would attack, even though part of her was sure he wouldn’t. She didn’t know why she was following his instructions, she just knew she had to. Using all the strength she had, she pulled the heavy dumpster away from the brick wall to look behind it. On the ground was a partially bloodied glove. At first, she didn’t know why it mattered, but then she noticed there was something rotting and mushy on the outside. Whatever it was seemed stuck on the plastic glove, and they had handled it after they had cut themselves. Could it be the remnants of a mushroom? Mia was sure she was the only one who handled the mushrooms after they got back from the farmers’ market. Then she remembered she had Henry clean and dry them. She went inside and called for the remaining officer who was standing in the kitchen like some sentinel. Grudgingly, he followed her after he told the rest to remain where they were. Once outside, Kevin looked around. “What’d’ya want to show me?”“Behind the dumpster. I’m not sure if it’s anything, but to me it looks like one of our gloves with a touch of blood inside and what looks like a rotten mushroom outside. I thought it might be evidence.” Giving her a doubting look, he peered behind the heavy metal container and spotted what she was referring to. “Did you touch it?”“No.”“Don’t. I’ll get an evidence bag from the car and be right back.” He quickly hastened down the alleyway towards the street. Mia turned to the cat and stared. She felt like she was going insane. Or maybe she just imagined it all. Moments later, Officer Easton returned with a plastic bag marked evidence in bright red letters across it. Using the inside of the bag, he picked up the discarded glove, turned the bag back and sealed it. “Good work,” he mumbled, then headed back into the kitchen. The cat moved over to sit beside Mia. Without a word, she stared at him in confusion. “Meow, meow?” { You can really hear me? }“Yes. I don’t know how, but I can. How can you even be talking to me so that I understand what you’re saying? I’m dreaming, right? I’ve turned fifteen and am now having a nervous breakdown. Or those cupcakes got me lit on something higher than chocolate.” Eve walked out then. “Mia? Who are you talking to?” The older woman moved to sit next to her daughter. “No one, Mom. Just flipping my lid is all.”“What do you mean? And who is your cute little friend?” Mia shrugged. “I don’t know. He’s been coming around since opening night and I have been giving him some scraps of food.” She didn’t want to tell her mom why she suddenly felt the need to see a shrink and get some happy pills. Maybe she was on some TV show, like Punk’d or Impractical Jokers , and wondered when the hidden cameras were going to pop up. “Were you talking to him?” Mia gave her a puzzled look. “Sure. Why not? I was talking to the cat.” Eve tilted her head slightly as she looked the animal over. “And is he talking to you?”“What?”“Is the cat talking to you?” Eve was dead serious, but Mia felt like she entered the Twilight Zone.

       "   'text': 'Authored by Dagny Taggart via The Organic Prepper blog,\\nTechnology that was once only seen in dystopian science fiction is rapidly infecting real life. Two means of collecting personal data – DNA databases and facial recognition software – are forming an unholy alliance, and the privacy implications could be devastating.\\nPrivacy concerns surrounding DNA and facial recognition aren’t anything new. As the popularity of DNA genealogy websites like Ancestry DNA and 23andMe increase, so do questions over who has access to that data and how it will be used. The use of facial recognition and other biometric data technology is on the rise, and people are expressing concerns (and outrage) about that technology as well.\\nGenealogy sites have been making the news of late, mainly for concerns over how our personal data is used – and who has access to that information.\\nRecently, GEDmatch , which has more than 1 million genetic profiles in its database, decided to stop providing information to police without user permission. Last month, the site faced criticism when it allowed Utah police to use the database while investigating a violent assault. “Prior to the change, GEDmatch had allowed police to use its data only for rapes and homicides,” reports Bloomberg:\\nThe site is now asking users whether they want to allow police to access their DNA information. Previously, law enforcement could search profiles in the database unless a customer explicitly opted out.\\nLaw enforcement agencies have increasingly relied on GEDmatch after it was used to find a man suspected of killing at least 12 people and raping scores of women in California between 1976 and 1986. A distant relative of the alleged Golden State Killer had uploaded DNA into GEDmatch. The genetic profile partially matched crime-scene evidence, indicating the person was related to the anonymous suspect who had eluded capture for four decades. From there, investigators built out that person’s family tree, which led to the arrest last year of a 72-year-old former police officer. ( source )\\nEngineers are figuring out how to match DNA to faces in a database. Now, DNA and facial recognition have merged, a development that is sure to ignite new concerns over privacy and how our most personal data is collected and used.\\nA team of engineers just built an algorithm that scans through a database of images and selects the faces that could be linked to the DNA found at a crime scene. Until now, predicting what someone’s face looks like based on a DNA sample has eluded scientists. But, it is getting easier for them to use samples to filter the right face from a database, as an international team led by researchers at KU Leuven has shown. Their findings were published in Nature Communications .\\nOur physical appearance (including our facial details) is hardwired into our genetic material. Scientists have already identified multiple genes that determine the shape of our face – from the distance between our nostrils to the shape of our chin. Some of that research was also conducted by a team at KU Leuven. Back in 2018, they identified fifteen genes that determine our facial features. In a related press release , the researchers explained the technique they used:\\nIn a new study conducted by KU Leuven in collaboration with the universities of Pittsburgh, Stanford and Penn State, the researchers adopted a different approach. “Our search doesn’t focus on specific traits,” lead author Peter Claes (KU Leuven) explains. “My colleagues from Pittsburgh and Penn State each provided a database with 3D images of faces and the corresponding DNA of these people. Each face was automatically subdivided into smaller modules. Next, we examined whether any locations in the DNA matched these modules. This modular division technique made it possible for the first time to check for an unprecedented number of facial features.” ( source )\\nAs of now, the ability to use that information to find a match between a DNA sample from a crime scene and someone in a DNA database does not exist, but it appears scientists are getting closer to making that a possibility.\\nIn a press release, Claes, an electrotechnical engineer at KU Leuven and the senior and corresponding author of the new study, explained why that remains a challenge:\\n“We believe that the shape of our face is determined by thousands of genes, but also by the food we eat and other living conditions. Therefore, it is unlikely that we will ever be able to accurately predict a lifelike face from DNA alone.”\\nThis technology could be used to solve crimes…or for less honorable purposes. For forensic analysis and other applications, the ideal scenario would be to find a match between a DNA sample from a crime scene and someone in a DNA database. If the DNA doesn’t match anyone in the database, however, it could still be used to predict what the perpetrator’s face looks like and make a sketch. This sketch could then be compared to a database with the faces of known criminals, for example, Claes said :\\n“This method mostly helps rule people out. In practice, we don’t usually get any further than a sort of reference face, such as ‘a European male’. That’s not much use to a forensic investigator. Unfortunately, while we are learning about more and more genes that determine certain aspects of our face, this does not yet sufficiently translate to a better match between the predicted face and the faces in the database.”\\nTo overcome this obstacle, the researchers developed a “reverse approach”, as explained in the press release :\\n“Instead of going from DNA to face, we’re trying to go from face to DNA. Using special software, we measure each face and check if this face is a possible outcome based on a unique bit of DNA.”\\n“It then becomes a game of ‘guess who’. If the face is male and the DNA says it is a woman, all the men are eliminated. If the hair is blond and the genetic material confirms this, that eliminates all other hair colours. “\\n“The more genes we identify, the more accurate this method becomes, and it will only continue to improve as our knowledge of the relevant genes grows.”\\nSo what if the face you’re looking for is not in the database? “Then you will at least have a list of faces that look a lot like the one you are looking for. Instead of a single reference face, such as ‘Asian female’, you will have a list of Asian females who are most similar to the person you want to find.” ( source )\\nIf your face isn’t in a database yet, it likely will be soon. For this technology to be useful, large face databases will be needed, such as ID card or driver’s license databases. Obviously, privacy issues are a huge concern. Claes acknowledges this fact. “Working with databases that contain private information such as DNA or faces requires strict supervision to prevent misuse,” he said .\\nBy 2021, 97% of travelers will have their faces scanned. In some stores, “smart” refrigerators “analyze” your face and track your irises (but don’t worry – the company says they aren’t using true facial recognition). Amazon is developing software called Rekognition that can identify anything it’s looking at – including your face. Surveillance systems are insidious , sneaking into our lives at every turn.\\nTags Technology Internet',\n",

       "   'text': \"I really needed a new eye makeup remover, as mine all sorta ran out around the same time [including my Charlotte Tilbury sample from last year's Advent Calendar & this one I'd quite enjoyed... typical ] - so when I was given the chance to try one from organic huns Natura Siberica , I jumped at the chance.\\nNatura Siberica are celebrating the launch of 16 of their hero products into Holland & Barrett on May 27th , which is a bit exciting [and good to know, cos I'll definitely be checking out more of the range after my positive experience with the products of theirs I've tried so far!] - and as part of this celebration, sent me their Natura Siberica Moisturising Foam Eye Make Up Remover * [which is just £5.75 ] to try.\\nAnd I love it .\\nThe brand themselves are affordable AF [as this huge bottle of eye makeup remover for just £5.75 is testament to!] - with a huge range of natural organic certified products which can also be found in Sainsbury's , Amazon and LoveLula . I love their luxurious packaging & branding... and the fact they're also cruelty-free & environmentally conscious rocks my proverbial socks [I never wear socks, they do my head in.]\\nTheir new venture with Holland & Barrett reflects the two brands' shared core values; using natural & organic ingredients that contribute to both our wellness and that of the world 💗\\nNatura Siberica products are made from wild-harvested herbs & flowers from the remote lands of Siberia - and are based on the traditional remedies of ancient Siberian tribes. The brand work with these local tribes, bringing about positive changes in their lives - which is yet another reason to love them. Onto the remover now anyway , before I get all emosh about the world & cruelty-free products / fluffy pets.\\nAs I already mentioned, I properly love this product . It's affordable, cruelty-free, beautifully packaged and 99% natural. In the bottle its liquid, but when dispensed, it's a foam consistency - like a mousse fake tan.\\nThis foaming eye makeup remover's formula is lovely . Like, it's a dream . It doesn't burn or sting, it's suitable for sensitive skin, it isn't really oily & doesn't leave any unpleasant residue behind... and it doesn't dry out my skin either. It's fresh, really gentle and actually really effective at shifting mascara & lash glue, too.\\nAnd - to top it all off - this cleansing dreamboat smells LOVELY... like baby powder mixed with a little slither of heaven. It leaves your skin smelling so sweet after use, which I love. I really, really rate it huns - and would defo suggest heading down to ya local Holland & Barrett to check it out for yourself .\\nHave you tried any of Natura Siberica 's products before? *Gifted item and sponsored post, but all opinions and professions of love are totes legit & my own xo **As with all posts on this site, this one may contain affiliate links.

       "   'text': 'Contact 韓國女裝批發– Unique Facts About The Topic..\\nThe web is a global marketplace which has opened a universe of opportunities to entrepreneurs worldwide. In case you are thinking about setting up 韓國批發 of your own, this is the perfect time to make that idea happen. Here are some points to consider.\\nEstablish your niche. It is possible to sell virtually anything online, so focusing on one product to sell can be quite a daunting task. However, choosing a niche and concentrating on that market is one of the most significant steps to succeeding in website marketing. Selecting your niche market can be carried out in several ways. The simplest way will be to take a look at gaps available in the market and try to fill that gap. Or, you are able to put a brand new twist over a popular product based on the demands in the market.\\nSet up your e commerce website and commercial accounts. This needs to be easily navigable, full of updated details about products and costs in addition to should be secure. It is possible to hire professional designers or make your website on your own. Makes up about dropping and receiving payments should also be setup.\\nMarket yourself. This is where 50 % of the work is available in. so that you can start conducting business customers have to know which you exist. Establishing a web-based presence can be carried out with a website, a good sales page, and a few advertising. Should you be starting from the base, posting on forums, blogs and networking sites details about your site and merchandise will help get the word out. The wider your contacts, the larger pool of potential prospects you have.\\nWhen it comes to selling the quickest way would be to sell items that need to be sold. Most entrepreneurs turn to eBay for this particular. Selling drop ship products is one way to promote stuff on eBay. The advantage of this process is that you simply do not need to adopt inventory and do not have to have your product or service with you. You simply accept orders and payments, inform the drop ship supplier in the purchases and they can send the products right to the clients. There are plenty of drop ship suppliers using the services of online merchants on eBay.\\nThe significance of an E-Commerce Website for your Web Store Business. An e-commerce website is among the simple requirements in case you are building a web-based store business. This can be basically your internet store that you post your product or service and where your prospects search for products. This is also where they create their purchases so that your website needs to be secure. There are many reasons why an e-commerce website is the better substitute for a traditional brick and mortar store. For just one, you don’t need to pay the rent. Domain hosts usually costs a few bucks a month, you do not have to be concerned about up the place and you don’t have to pay for maintenance costs. Granted, you need to purchase a specialist to design your website. You also need to buy security and ecommerce software to obtain your small business above the ground.\\nLets get some things taken care of. Simply because you do have a website with many products does not always mean, that individuals are likely to come to your web page, using their credit cards in their hand and get the merchandise jttmaj promote. For those who have heard of anybody or anyone tell you that a treatment program or perhaps a system, they may have, could make you rich overnight and acquire you out of debt – they are plain lying. Why? Any business or any venture you start includes a learning curve and time and energy to grow. If it lacks a learning curve or time and energy to grow, your business or venture would fall as quickly as it grew.\\nSo to ensure you to start an internet store, do you have to have products? Possibly not. Why? Because big stores like e-bay and Amazon have a lot of sellers who are selling products. These big sites are able to pay you a percentage with their profits, in the event you could drive traffic to their sellers. This may enable big online retailers like e-bay and Amazon, to supply the best service they could provide for their sellers.\\nNow, What role would you play by beginning an online store? Good question. The role you play is providing content towards the websites. Permit me to break it down. For example, you see that people would like to buy flat screen TV online or an Music player online. You could perform some research, online obviously, see what models can be found, the models that are selling good, the models that the consumers are most satisfied with and write about it on your own blog or maybe your website etc. Then you could become an associate to Amazon or e-bay and display those products on your own blogs or website. Usually do not try to scam or spam people online, it is not good. 韓國女裝批發– Unique Facts About The Topic..',\n",

       "   'text': \"On Tour with Prism Book Tours The Thirteenth Guardian Paperback & ebook, 307 Pages June 11th 2019 DA VINCI'S SECRET PALES. Michelangelo concealed an explosive truth in his famous Creation of Adam fresco in the Sistine Chapel. Eve did not cause the fall of man. She carried a far more devastating secret for millennia—one that will change the world forever. As the modern-day world suffers the cataclysmic effects of the “ Plagues of Egypt ,” Avery Fitzgerald, a statuesque Astrophysics major at Stanford, discovers that she is mysteriously bound to five strangers by an extremely rare condition that foremost medical experts cannot explain. Thrust into extraordinary circumstances, they race against time to stay alive as they are pursued by an age-old adversary and the world around them collapses into annihilation. Under sacred oath, The Guardians—a far more archaic and enigmatic secret society than the Freemasons, Templars, and the Priory—protect Avery as she embarks on a daring quest that only legends of old have been on before. Avery must come to terms with the shocking realization that the blood of an ancient queen flows through her veins and that the fate of the world now rests on her shoulders. The Thirteenth Guardian is Book One of a daring new Trilogy that will shake you to your core. Goodreads │ Amazon │ Barnes & Noble About the Author K.M.

of 1The japan ground properly so called consists of the varnish and pigment where the whole surface is to be of one simple colour or of the varnish with or without pigment on which some painting or other form of decoration is afterwards to be applied It is best to form this ground with the desired pigment incorporated with shellac varnish except in the case of a white japan ground which requires special treatment or when great brilliancy is a desideratum and other methods must be adopted The shellac varnish for the japan ground is best prepared as follows shellac 114 lb methylated spirits 1 gallon Dissolve in a wellcorked vessel in a warm place and with frequent shaking After two or three days the shellac will be dissolved It is then recommended to filter the solution through a flannel bag and when all that will come through freely has done so the varnish should be run into a proper sized vessel and kept carefully corked for use The bag may then be squeezed with the hand till the remainder of the fluid varnish is forced through it and this if fairly clear may be used for rough purposes or added to the next batch Pigments of any nature whatever may be used with the shellac varnish to give the desired tint to the ground and where necessary they may be mixed together to form any compound colour such as blue and yellow to form green The pigments used for japan grounds should all be previously ground very smooth in spirits of turpentine so smooth that the paste does not grate between the two thumb nails and then only are they mixed with the varnish This mixture of pigment and varnish vehicle should then be spread over the surface to be japanned very carefully and very evenly with a camelhair brush As metals do not require a priming coat of size and whiting the japan ground may be applied to metallic surfaces forthwith without any preliminary treatment except thorough cleansing except in the cases specially referred to further on On metallic surfaces three to four coats are applied and in the interval between each coat the articles must be stoved in an oven heated to from 250 to 300 FThe figure shows a section through single chamber japanning and

people dont know what a true serving of each food group isCare must be taken for lightcoloured japans or enamels not to have the temperature sufficiently high to scorch or the surface will be discoloured as they require a lower temperature for fixing than the dark japans which provided the article is not likely to be injured by the heat are usually dried at a somewhat high temperature The preceding instructions apply only to the best descriptions of work Culinary Gardenerd Unlike most Romans Antony wore a full beard His forehead was large and his nose was of the distinctive Roman type His look was so bold and masculine that people likened him to Hercules His democratic manners endeared him to the army He wore a plain tunic covered with a large coarse mantle and carried a huge sword at his side despising ostentation Even his faults and follies added to his popularity He would sit down at the common soldiers mess and drink with them telling them stories and clapping them on the

       "   'text': \"Stock\\nIf I’m listing Amazon products, those are going to be my primary considerations.\\nImages : Follow Amazon’s requirements , and provide clean, clear images. The more images, the more reassurance for the prospective customer that this is the right product for them.\\nAmazon’s Choice Badge : Amazon hasn’t spoken much on how your products can get chosen for this. My thought and what other are speculating is that you must sell a lot of products, and it needs to have consistently great reviews. It’s a confirmation that the products being sold are widely liked, and something they’ll be confident putting towards the top of the search results. They’ve hinted at this too.\\nStar Rating : Sell a quality product, deliver quality customer service, respond to questions and comments. I don’t purchase products with under 4 stars. It’s important to make sure your products get reviews, and continue to bring them in.\\nPrice (Range) + Saving’s/Coupon : Make sure you have the price range or prices in place, and if you have a coupon/discount of some sort, that will also appear in the SERP’s, highlighted above Prime. It really stands out\\nAmazon Prime or not : This is something many folks filter to make sure the product will ship in 2 days for free. It’s part of what brought Amazon to be the Amazon it is today. I think that buyers have an association with prime and a trusted seller as well. Here’s more information on setting prime up as a seller .\\nStock: Keeping track is important for your business, but also shows users how many products are left. With certain products, the short supply could even encourage a quicker purchase process, and help you sell out. Optimization based off of the algorithm:\\nText Match Relevancy: If you do a search on Amazon for men’s size 12 black loafers, you’d probably be very happy if the search results in front of you all had that phrase or most of it in the product title. Amazon uses the text in your product listing to identify searches your product would be a great part of. Make it targeted based off of keyword research, assure users they’ve found what they’ve been looking for or at least a great option, and you’ll be in a great position.\\nAvailability of Stock: You need to have products in the fulfillment center, or indicate availability estimates . Think about it, why would Amazon list a product at the top of the results if it wasn’t going to have stock for a while? It’s not good for user-experience or their reputation.\\nPrice: Price is important in numerous ways that stretch beyond Amazon. It has to be the right price for your target market, it has to be at the right price point versus competition. If folks’ sort by lowest to highest, or highest to lowest, the way you are priced has an impact.\\nMore Sales vs. Other Competitor Sales: Outperforming competitors in your space is indicative that your products are of high-quality. With Amazon if you are selling and getting great reviews, you can consistently grow product sales. Amazon SEO in Summary\\nAmazon wants their users and prime members to be happy. Providing high quality products that generate great reviews makes them look good, and makes their users happy. That’s why their search engine algorithm is based around these components, and the elements that influence them. Go above and beyond with Amazon’s requirements, have responsive customer service, consider the user, and you’ll have a much better opportunity to increase product sales.\\nIf you have any experiences, you’d be willing to share, we’d love to hear about them in the comments!\\nNeed help with Amazon SEO, or building it into your digital marketing strategy?

of 1The japan ground properly so called consists of the varnish and pigment where the whole surface is to be of one simple colour or of the varnish with or without pigment on which some painting or other form of decoration is afterwards to be applied It is best to form this ground with the desired pigment incorporated with shellac varnish except in the case of a white japan ground which requires special treatment or when great brilliancy is a desideratum and other methods must be adopted The shellac varnish for the japan ground is best prepared as follows shellac 114 lb methylated spirits 1 gallon Dissolve in a wellcorked vessel in a warm place and with frequent shaking After two or three days the shellac will be dissolved It is then recommended to filter the solution through a flannel bag and when all that will come through freely has done so the varnish should be run into a proper sized vessel and kept carefully corked for use The bag may then be squeezed with the hand till the remainder of the fluid varnish is forced through it and this if fairly clear may be used for rough purposes or added to the next batch Pigments of any nature whatever may be used with the shellac varnish to give the desired tint to the ground and where necessary they may be mixed together to form any compound colour such as blue and yellow to form green The pigments used for japan grounds should all be previously ground very smooth in spirits of turpentine so smooth that the paste does not grate between the two thumb nails and then only are they mixed with the varnish This mixture of pigment and varnish vehicle should then be spread over the surface to be japanned very carefully and very evenly with a camelhair brush As metals do not require a priming coat of size and whiting the japan ground may be applied to metallic surfaces forthwith without any preliminary treatment except thorough cleansing except in the cases specially referred to further on On metallic surfaces three to four coats are applied and in the interval between each coat the articles must be stoved in an oven heated to from 250 to 300 FThe figure shows a section through single chamber japanning and
