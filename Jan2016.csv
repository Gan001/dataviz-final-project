Dimiter Kenarov asks us to accept Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea (“Ending Crimea’s Isolation,” Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Dec. 27). We should not.

In 2014 Russia invaded Crimea, part of sovereign Ukraine, sending in Russian soldiers in unmarked uniforms to occupy the peninsula. This was the first armed, cross-border invasion of one European country by another since World War II. President Vladimir V. Putin first denied sending the Russian Army into Crimea. He later admitted that he had lied. (He also denied sending the Russian military into the Donbass region, in southeastern Ukraine, and has tacitly admitted that he lied about that, too.)

The United States never recognized the Soviet annexation of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania in World War II. It took more than 60 years, but the three Baltic countries are now members of the European Union and NATO. The West should never recognize the attempted annexation of Crimea.

As we did in the Second World War and during the Cold War, we should resist armed aggression against sovereign nations. We should maintain and toughen the economic sanctions in coordination with the European Union until Russia withdraws from Donbass and Crimea.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/05/opinion/whither-crimea.html

And now in many ways, a little piece of Bundyville has re-emerged here in east-central Oregon, in the temper and tone of a Bundy-family led crew of armed, antigovernment acolytes who are occupying a federal wildlife reserve, calling for Washington to hand control of federal lands to ranchers and local governments, and seeking to unwind a century of policy that has shaped the West.

Brookstone, which filed for bankruptcy in 2014 and restructured under new ownership, hopes the creations that emerge from Brookstone Launch will be a cornerstone of its product portfolio.

A more popular option is to solicit ideas from the masses. The grocery retailer FreshDirect ran a contest on RocketHub for new food products, and Hasbro used Indiegogo to seek party game concepts.

Take it from one who knows. A sprightly 68-year-old, Mr. Seelig is one of the artistic directors of the London International Mime Festival, which he founded in 1977. He remains fully aware that the art form is scoffed at or misconceived by a public that sees it either botched or pastiched or reduced to one name, Marcel Marceau.

Yet the London festival, which fills stages across the city every January, is actually a diverse mix of circus, physical theater, puppetry, clowning and mask shows — anything that keeps words to a minimum. By the time “mime” fell out of fashion, the festival’s name had stuck, and over four decades it has had a significant impact on British theater, disrupting the dominance of scripted plays — something that hasn’t quite happened the same way in the United States.

It’s why Cheryl Henson, president of the Jim Henson Foundation and the puppetmaster’s daughter, visits every year, having found nothing comparable at home. “Mime has a bit of bad rep in the States,” she said. “People think it will take itself too seriously.” The London gathering retains its lightness: “There’s a playfulness about the way it’s curated,” she said.

Other politicians, including some governors and members of Congress, now specifically label Syrian refugees a threat.

The focus on whether or not to admit these desperate people to the United States obscures the bigger question of the refugee crisis. A vast majority of the more than four million refugees want to return to Syria once the war there ends. For that reason, most have stayed in the region, often languishing for years in camps in Lebanon and Jordan, rather than migrating to Europe or attempting to enter the United States. According to estimates from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, there are some 634,000 refugees still in Jordan, 1.1 million in Lebanon and 2.3 million in Turkey.

These people are the responsibility of the international community, according to the 1951 Refugee Convention. The United States and all other signatories to the convention have a legal obligation to protect refugees and their well-being, which can mean resettlement when necessary.

I have met and talked with refugees in camps in Jordan and roadside tent settlements in Lebanon and those arriving on rubber boats in Greece. They are the furthest things from radical Islamic jihadists. They fled their villages after nearly five years of war in a final act of desperation. The shelling was incessant, as was the fighting. They were squeezed on all sides — by the Islamic State, by the forces of President Bashar al-Assad and by other rebels. They feared conscription and kidnapping. Many are professionals, including lawyers, dentists and engineers. Yet they had no work and couldn’t feed their families. These are not terrorists; they are victims of terrorism.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/opinion/how-to-help-the-syrians-who-want-to-return-home.html
