      "Here are the facts about diesel straight from the Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board: Clean diesel technology and fuels have reduced particulate matter and nitrogen oxide emissions by more than 98 percent, and sulfur content by 97 percent. The American Lung Association cites clean diesel fleets as one of the two primary reasons for improved air quality in the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet Taras Grescoe conflates emissions from 18-wheelers with those from passenger cars, while laying blame on diesel for all traffic, health, emissions and air pollution problems — all in an attempt to say that the new generation of diesel is not clean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diesel remains the technology of choice for the trucks, ships, trains and machines of our industrialized world — including more than two-thirds of all public transit buses — because it works, providing the best combination of efficiency, power, reliability and now environmental performance. Just before the Paris climate talks, San Francisco and Oakland announced that their municipal fleets would use clean diesel technology and renewable diesel fuels instead of alternative fuels.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for references to the Volkswagen scandal, readers are smart enough not to confuse one company’s bad choices on emissions compliance as reflective of other manufacturers or diesel technology in general.\n"
