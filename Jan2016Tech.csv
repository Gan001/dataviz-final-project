But given the proliferation of entertainment choices online, life without cable no longer seems impossible.

In early December, I canceled my “triple play” package of TV, telephone and Internet service with Time Warner Cable and switched to a stand-alone Internet access plan. That cut my monthly bill by about $100, without having any impact on how much time I spend in front of my television. Netflix and Amazon Prime have seen to that.

I’ve plowed through the Netflix drama “Sense8” and watched the 2014 movie “Interstellar” on Amazon. Next up is the Amazon series “The Man in the High Castle.” Later, when I run out of things I want to watch on those two services, I might drop them and subscribe to Hulu or HBO Now to watch the movies and TV shows in their libraries.

In 2004, lawmakers passed legislation that required Homeland Security officials to accelerate efforts to create an automated biometric entry and exit data system.
Congress repeated its demand for a biometric exit system in 2007 and set a deadline for 2009.
Despite the call by some lawmakers for an exit system, airports and the airline industry have balked because it would cost airlines $3 billion, according to a 2013 Homeland Security estimate.
The department issued regulations in 2008 requiring airports to collect biometric exit information, but carriers have largely ignored the regulation, and there have been no sanctions.","['visas', 'collect', 'foreign', 'system', 'security', 'information', 'doesnt', 'overstay', 'department', 'report', 'officials', 'exit', 'biometric', 'homeland', 'visitors', 'know']","In early 2013, Janet Napolitano, then the secretary of Homeland Security, testified before Congress that the agency planned to issue a report on overstay rates by December 2013. The agency did not follow through because officials said they did not have confidence in the quality of the data. Mr. Bersin said last month that the report would be issued in the next six months.

Many members of Congress and some law enforcement officials worry that terrorists could exploit the visa program because the United States does not routinely collect biometric information — fingerprints, iris scans and photographs that can be used for facial recognition — of people leaving the country. Nearly three dozen countries, including many in Europe, Asia and Africa, collect such information.

“U.S. airports and other entry and exit points were never designed with departure control in mind,” said Theresa Cardinal Brown, the director of Immigration Policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington and a Department of Homeland Security official under President George W. Bush. “If we want to do that it’s going to mean building a lot more infrastructure.”

The 9/11 Commission report called the establishment of an entry and exit biometric system “fundamental to intercepting terrorists” trying to enter the United States because it would allow law enforcement officials to determine if a traveler had overstayed a visa.

Still, efforts to build such a system to collect the information have stalled for decades. In 2004, lawmakers passed legislation that required Homeland Security officials to accelerate efforts to create an automated biometric entry and exit data system. Congress repeated its demand for a biometric exit system in 2007 and set a deadline for 2009. But the deadline passed, with the department putting into place only a handful of pilot programs.

Since then, the department has continued to struggle to meet this requirement. A 2013 report by the Government Accountability Office said the Department of Homeland Security had more than one million “unmatched” arrival records, meaning that those records could not be checked against other information showing that the individuals had left the country, but again the department could not offer a precise number.

The median call time in the study was two to two and a half hours per month.
Dr. Cardis is now conducting a large government-funded study in Europe of the potential risks of cellphone use among children.
“If there’s a risk, it’s likely to be greater for exposures at younger ages,” she said, “simply because the skull is thinner and the ears are thinner in children than in adults.

When Berkeley, Calif., passed an ordinance last spring requiring retailers to warn customers that radiation emitted by cellphones could be hazardous, CTIA-The Wireless Association, an industry trade group, sued. It called the ordinance “scientifically baseless and alarmist,” adding that the federal government had determined that “cellphones approved for sale in the United States, however worn, are safe for everyone.” The lawsuit is pending.

The study cited most often is Interphone, a multination review published by the I.A.R.C. in 2010. CTIA, in a statement, noted that Interphone found “over all, no increase in risk.” But Interphone did find “some indications of an increased risk of glioma,” a type of brain tumor, among the heaviest 10 percent of cellphone users, though “the researchers concluded that biases and errors limit the strength of these conclusions and prevent a causal interpretation.”

Dr. Elisabeth Cardis, Interphone’s principal investigator, said in an interview, “I can’t say for sure there’s an effect, but I can’t say for sure there’s no effect.”

However, the usage rates studied were far lower than those seen now, she said. The median call time in the study was two to two and a half hours per month. A Nielsen study in 2014 found that Americans used smartphones more than 34 hours a month, on average, though more often for games or social media than for communications.

Dr. Cardis is now conducting a large government-funded study in Europe of the potential risks of cellphone use among children. Nevertheless, she uses a mobile phone herself, as do her children — though she said it was prudent to use headsets or speakerphone, or to text, instead of holding the device next to your ear.

He used to counsel people to try cutting their smoking habit in half. And for himself, he has done something similar: Instead of going on a strict diet, he went to a doctor who uses data to show people how what they eat affects them medically.

When it comes to a fitness goal, the mind-set is slightly different. James O’Connor, 44, who lives in Far Hills, N.J., and works in asset management, said that after the wear and tear of decades of commuting and working, he had committed to doing his second Ironman triathlon in November 2016.

For him, there are certainly financial costs. It cost $700 to enter the Ironman in Tempe, Ariz., and travel costs will be much more. He plans to do two half-Ironman triathlons for training. And then there is the gear needed to train and compete in events that encompass swimming, biking and running. He estimated that cost at more than $1,000.

But those expenses are not Mr. O’Connor’s primary concern. What motivates him are the larger costs, in economic terms, of what he will miss this year. He got his work colleagues and his family to sign off on his participation since they will see him less. He also enlisted a friend to train with him and committed to raising money for charity so he will not be doing the Ironman solely for himself.

“The Ironman is a very selfish race,” he said. “It’s a huge amount of personal commitment. The more people who are part of it, the less selfish it seems.”

“Solar home systems have been around for a long time by now, and they are a successful model,” said Robert Stoner, the director of the Tata Center for Technology and Design at M.I.T., which works directly with Selco and others, including the Indian government, on renewable technology development. “Their challenge is that they cost a lot — far more than the average person has, even a relatively well-off person.”

So if it is difficult to persuade a middle-class family in an industrialized country to invest in solar, how do you persuade a family that lives on a couple dollars a day?

Mr. Prasad is a consummate salesman who talks a mile a minute, wears his hair in a side-part and keeps three pens in his breast pocket. On his home turf in the villages of the Chikkamagaluru district in Karnataka, his salesmanship is put to the test. If he can manage to interest people in what is often an unfamiliar technology, he then pitches his potential customers on the more mysterious, but crucial idea of financing.

For two decades, Selco has worked to persuade a network of banks to provide financing options to poor people who were typically seen as too risky. As Mohan Hegde, the company’s operations manager, noted, “The idea behind Selco is to take a poor man to the bank and see if what he can afford to pay per month is acceptable to the lenders.”

The sales presentation, once it includes assurance of financing from a bank, is much more palatable to potential customers: Pay the bank monthly installments of roughly the same price you’d spend on kerosene, and in a few short years, you’ll own the system and your basic energy needs will be fulfilled by the sun free.

“When we say free, their ears prick up,” Mr. Prasad said.

Without financing, decentralized renewable energy could never compete in India with kerosene, which is cheap because the government subsidizes its sale at a cost of more than $5 billion a year.

The company flew him to a Microsoft hackathon in Seattle, where he challenged its corps of technologists to come up with a chair that he could drive with his eyes. Twenty-four hours later, they produced a prototype. Microsoft then hired Mr. Gleason as a consultant as it proceeded to fine-tune the chair and also improve the tablet’s compatibility with eye-gaze technology.

The chair, not yet available to the public, is now Mr. Gleason’s sole mode of transportation. He types using a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 equipped with a panel that has an infrared camera and rests at the bottom of the tablet, made by a company called Tobii Dynavox. The camera follows his eye movements. He uses his eyes the way another person would use a finger to tap on the tablet. He opens an app by setting his gaze on the icon for it, and he types by looking at a digital keyboard on the screen and staring at each letter or number he wants for two-tenths of a second. He types 20 words per minute; 40 w.p.m. is widely considered to be the average typing speed for people using their hands.

“I can do anything an ordinary person can do on a tablet computer,” he writes. “Talk, videoconference, text, stream music, buy Christmas presents online, pay bills, tweet.” He can also drive his wheelchair and take selfies. He used his iPhone and a GoPro camera to record thousands of hours of his life for his son, who was born the year of his diagnosis, to watch in the future. The video was used to make the film “Gleason,” which will have its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival this month.

But many A.L.S. patients cannot afford such tech tools, and health insurance does not always cover them. Communication devices like Mr. Gleason’s cost $12,000 to $20,000. So through Team Gleason, he distributes technology to those in need and coordinates training sessions led by speech pathologists in how to use it. The organization has disbursed about $2.4 million in devices and training so far, according to Ms. Durrett. Last year, the group successfully pushed for passage of the Steve Gleason Act, which ensures full access to eye-tracking and speech-generating devices through Medicare.

Next month, Team Gleason will begin operating a residence in New Orleans for people with A.L.S. and other neuro-degenerative diseases called the Team Gleason House. The 18 residents selected to live there will be able to use tablets not just for communication, but also to adjust the height of their beds, open and close doors, and turn on TV sets and change the channels. The purpose of the house is to “allow A.L.S. patients to be productive and purposeful,” Mr. Gleason writes. Chase Bank, along with Tom Benson, the owner of the New Orleans Saints, have helped finance it.

The nonprofit ALS Association, which was one of the main beneficiaries of the $220 million generated by the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge in 2014, is using some of those donations to spur technological development as well. In November, it announced that it would award several grants totaling at least $500,000 to hardware and software developers with the most innovative new technology for people who cannot speak or use their limbs.

The beneficiaries of all such advancements also include those with cerebral palsy, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease or Rett syndrome, and people who have brain and spinal cord injuries. Even more broadly, Mr. Gleason sees this technology as “not only for those with physical limitations, but as cutting-edge innovations for the global marketplace,” he writes.

I was slightly unnerved: Was the mail being stolen? He then went over to another mailbox with the flag up, and emptied that box, too. I got my hint when he skipped the mailbox with the flag down.

Yes, I was told, in the United States, mail gets picked up from your house, six days a week, free of charge.

I told my friends in Turkey about all this. They shook their heads in disbelief, wondering how easily I had been recruited as a C.I.A. agent, saying implausibly flattering things about my new country. The United States in the world’s imagination is a place of risk taking and ruthless competition, not one of reliable public services.

I bit my tongue and did not tell my already suspicious friends that the country was also dotted with libraries that provided books to all patrons free of charge. They wouldn’t believe me anyway since I hadn’t believed it myself. My first time in a library in the United States was very brief: I walked in, looked around, and ran right back out in a panic, certain that I had accidentally used the wrong entrance. Surely, these open stacks full of books were reserved for staff only. I was used to libraries being rare, and their few books inaccessible. To this day, my heart races a bit in a library.

Over the years, I’ve come to appreciate the link between infrastructure, innovation — and even ruthless competition. Much of our modern economy thrives here because you can order things online and expect them to be delivered. There are major private delivery services, too, but the United States Postal Service is often better equipped to make it to certain destinations. In fact, Internet sellers, and even private carriers, often use the U.S.P.S. as their delivery mechanism to addresses outside densely populated cities.

Almost every aspect of the most innovative parts of the United States, from cutting-edge medical research to its technology scene, thrives on publicly funded infrastructure. The post office is struggling these days, in some ways because of how much people rely on the web to do much of what they used to turn to the post office for. But the Internet is a testament to infrastructure, too: It exists partly because the National Science Foundation funded much of the research that makes it possible. Even some of the Internet’s biggest companies, like Google, got a start from N.S.F.-funded research.

Emily Bazelon wrote about how the word ‘‘radical’’ is used by politicians and movements — but becomes particularly fraught when attached to Islam.

I believe the term ‘‘radical’’ is being misused by today’s media. It is incorrect to refer to ISIS or Tea Party followers as radical. For the media, to continue to use the term ‘‘radical’’ in describing ISIS or the Tea Party is to contribute to our nation’s political confusion. The more appropriate term would be ‘‘reactionary.’’ Why? The political continuum from left to right is: radical, liberal, moderate, conservative, reactionary. Radicals want the most change when it comes to rights and freedoms. Reactionaries, on the other hand, want to go backward to a time when rights and freedoms were restricted.

ISIS and Tea Party followers want to restrict rights and freedoms for women, gays and minorities. Radicals, like Eugene Debs and Bernie Sanders, ­wanted or want just the opposite. It is correct to refer to both ends of the continuum as ‘‘extremist,’’ but this is descriptive and not judgmental. With the clarification of the word ‘‘radical’’ as used in the context of politics, the public will be much better able to distinguish the differences between the followers of ISIS and the followers of Bernie Sanders.

Yahoo’s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, spent much of the last two years telling Wall Street that video was a cornerstone of her turnaround strategy.

Now, Yahoo is vastly playing down its commitment to video. The Internet company confirmed Monday that its four-year-old video portal, called Yahoo Screen, was shut down last week. That follows the $42 million write-off on original video content that Yahoo took in October.

The popularity of Yahoo Screen paled in comparison with YouTube, but the portal still had a substantial audience: about 15 million unique visitors in the United States in November, according to comScore, a research firm.

It was also a one-stop destination where visitors could find all of the company’s video content — its licensed reruns of “Saturday Night Live,” original series like “Community,” a daily live-streamed concert from Live Nation, the National Football League game it streamed in October and clips from the company’s themed topic areas, which it calls digital magazines.

Now all that video has been scattered throughout the rest of Yahoo — and good luck finding it. A search for “Saturday Night Live” or “SNL” on Yahoo’s own search engine Monday sent you to NBC, YouTube and Hulu — everywhere but Yahoo. The results were similar when searching for “Community series.”

Arunav Sinha, a Yahoo spokesman, said that Yahoo decided to relocate its video content within the company’s various digital magazines. So the Live Nation concerts are on Yahoo Music and “Community” on Yahoo TV, albeit buried deep within menus on the mobile version of Yahoo. (Mr. Sinha said the “Saturday Night Live” reruns are temporarily offline while the company moves them.)

“We are better off promoting one destination like Yahoo Music than different destinations for music,” Mr. Sinha said.

Yahoo had devoted fewer resources to Screen in recent months, so the shutdown was not entirely a surprise to people who follow the company closely.

But Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research, said the decision, which was first reported online by Variety, reflected Yahoo’s shrinking video ambitions. He said the company would probably focus more of its efforts on creating cheap videos for its digital magazines, and selling ads around those, than on trying to land big-budget ads to support TV-style content that costs millions of dollars to produce or license.

“They won’t necessarily have less video,” he said. “They will have less expensive video.”",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/04/yahoo-shuts-down-its-video-portal/

The app will also incorporate an audio version, music, video, character portraits, family trees, images of period fashion and maps of Belgravia.

“To marry the traditions of the Victorian novel to modern technology, allowing the reader, or listener, an involvement with the characters and the background of the story and the world in which it takes place, that would not have been possible until now, and yet to preserve within that the strongest traditions of storytelling, seems to me a marvelous goal and a real adventure,” Mr. Fellowes said in a statement released through Grand Central Publishing, which will publish the novel in hardcover in July.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/04/business/media/new-julian-fellowes-project-belgravia-treads-new-digital-ground.html

Throngs of passengers move through the station on their way to Frankfurt’s many banks and its central shopping district.

And as in many German cities, the number of licensed taxis in Frankfurt is capped, at just over 1,700 cars, which means that at peak times, there is often more demand for rides than there are available taxis.

After Uber arrived, unlicensed drivers for UberPop soon began showing up near the main entrance of the train station, enticing potential passengers with discounted rates that were roughly one-third cheaper than those of the city’s licensed operators, according to Frankfurt’s taxi unions.

Such fares quickly set off opposition. Thomas Grätz, head of the Taxi and Rental Car Association, a German trade body, said Uber’s unlicensed drivers had not passed the same lengthy exams and were not subject to similar costs, like the professional drivers’ insurance required by the city’s traditional operators. Uber said its drivers were properly vetted and had appropriate insurance.

Confronted with a growing number of UberPop competitors, Taxi Deutschland, another German trade association, filed a legal challenge against Uber in mid-2014, claiming the company’s drivers did not have licenses to operate nationwide. That led to a long court odyssey of rulings and appeals.

As the legal tension mounted, Uber’s small Frankfurt team tried to drum up interest from locals, many of whom had never booked a taxi through a smartphone app or used a credit card to pay for a taxi. Unlike the United States and other European countries, Germany still has a low level of credit card use, according to industry statistics.

To change those habits, Uber began offering free rides and other incentives to new customers. That helped draw in people like Dan Miner, 32, an American researcher in Frankfurt who signed up for the service after first hearing about it from friends in New York. For Mr. Miner, hailing a taxi through a smartphone app, particularly late at night, was easier than flagging down a licensed taxi that charged for extras like using the trunk.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/04/technology/ubers-no-holds-barred-expansion-strategy-fizzles-in-germany.html

Mr. Mewes, the founder of a rival on-demand taxi smartphone application, MyTaxi, had considered running a service like Uberpop when he started his own company in 2009. Uberpop, Uber’s low-cost service, relies on unlicensed drivers and is similar to UberX in the United States.

But after talking to local authorities and taxi groups, Mr. Mewes, a 37-year-old German, soon realized that Germany’s tough transport rules — involving health exams, security checks and state-issued licenses for all taxi operators — would never allow such a low-cost service to operate freely in the country, Europe’s largest economy.

“In every country, you have to be prepared to change your setup,” said Mr. Mewes, whose start-up now operates across several European countries after being acquired by Daimler, the German automaker, in 2014. MyTaxi currently has 45,000 drivers using its online platform, with roughly half of them based in Germany. “That’s why Uber failed here. They aren’t willing to change when they enter a new country.”

Uber’s struggles in Germany represent one of the few instances in which the company has failed to succeed in its aggressive global expansion plans, which now include operations in more than 350 cities across five continents.

Late last year, for instance, the company pulled out of Frankfurt, Hamburg and Düsseldorf, citing onerous regulation and a lack of drivers operating on its online platform.

Uber’s low-cost service also has been banned nationwide, though the company is appealing. Uber now only offers licensed taxi services in Berlin and Munich, representing a small fraction of the tens of thousands of taxi drivers spread across Germany.

Mark MacGann, Uber’s head of policy in Europe, says that German taxi unions have lobbied hard to push Uber out of the market, and that the ride-booking service will eventually return to multiple cities across the country.

“Germany may end up being the final frontier of Uber’s success story in Europe,” he said. “I’m confident that Germany will be as big a market for us as the United Kingdom is right now.”

Yet while Uber has so far remained a bit player in Germany, local rivals — often in collaboration with licensed taxi operators — have expanded rapidly, taking advantage of their local regulatory and cultural know-how to succeed just as Uber has been forced to retreat.

As local consumers become more accustomed to using smartphone apps, many ride-booking companies now offer the same services as their larger American rival, including on-demand pickup and estimated prices for each ride, though other benefits like in-app payments are only now starting to be added.

The rise of these German rivals has raised questions of whether Uber, which has deep pockets after its latest funding round valued the ride-booking service at $62.5 billion, can ever catch up with local rivals that have attracted a loyal following despite their lack of comparable financial resources.

To re-establish itself in Germany, Uber must take on the likes of Hermann Waldner.

As the managing director of a Berlin taxi dispatch center, Mr. Waldner has not stood still when faced with Uber’s somewhat stumbling expansion plans, which have shifted from offering primarily unlicensed taxi services to those based on certified drivers.

Mr. Waldner also runs Taxi.eu, a rival smartphone application that relies solely on licensed drivers. Its service has grown rapidly over Germany and is now available in 12 countries from Belgium to Turkey. In total, Taxi.eu says it has around 160,000 drivers active on its online platform.

To compete, Mr. Waldner says, traditional taxi operators must embrace new technologies like smartphone applications, while also banding together across national borders to offer a one-size-fits-all service that can keep pace with Uber’s global offering.

“We need a strong network to fight against Uber,” he said. “That’s the only way to stay strong against Uber.”",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/04/as-uber-stumbles-german-rivals-prosper/

This week’s main feature was suggested by Dana Mackenzie, the regular Numberplay contributor, chess champion, hula enthusiast and award-winning mathematics writer. Here’s Dana kicking off the year with —

The Doubly Good Year

On the popular “Numberphile” YouTube channel, the comedian-mathematician Matt Parker recorded an amusing video called “Why 1980 was a great year to be born… but 2184 will be better.” Matt explains that for people who (like him) were born in 1980, when they get to 45 years old their age (45) will be the square root of the year (2025). Surprisingly, this behavior is rather uncommon.

Our first question: When will be the next “good year” like 1980? What if, instead of square roots, we allow any perfect root?

When he was playing around with this first question, Matt noticed an amazing thing: For people born in 2184, there will actually be two occasions to celebrate! First, when they get to 3 years old their age will be the 7th root of the year (2187). Then, in case they miss this great occasion, they will have another opportunity 10 years later, when their age (13) will be the cube root of the year (2197).

Naturally, this invites our second question: Are there any other years with this “doubly good” property?

That concludes The Doubly Good Year. I asked Dana to say a bit more about the puzzle, and it seems he stumbled upon the remarkable year 2184 independently from Matt. Here’s Dana:

In 2014, Alex Bellos came out with a new book with a chapter about “The World’s Favorite Number,” which he determined by a poll of more than 30,000 people. No surprise, the world’s favorite number was 7. I wrote an article about his poll, and realized that I didn’t personally have a favorite number. (I suspect that many mathematicians wouldn’t.) I wondered, “What should my favorite number be?” My first thought was 24, which has some wonderful geometric properties. However, I suspected that this was a very common choice. My second thought was 130, which is equal to both 5³ + 5 and 2⁷ + 2. I immediately suspected that this was the largest such number, and did a little bit of playing around with small powers to make sure there weren’t any other obvious examples. That’s when I stumbled on 2184, which has the very similar property of being equal to both 3⁷ – 3 and 13³ – 13.

The fact that 2184 has this property really floored me. Why? Richard Guy’s “Strong Law of Small Numbers” says that “There aren’t enough small numbers to meet the many demands made of them.” So some coincidences are inevitable. To me, 130 is almost small enough that it could be just a coincidence that it equals both 5³ + 5 and 2⁷ + 2. It’s surprising, but not startling. But to my thinking, 2184 is no longer a small number. And for it to be equal to both 3⁷ – 3 and 13³ – 13, spot on… I felt that there had to be a reason for this. It couldn’t be just coincidence.

Thanks, Dana! In fact, Dana assures us that this is not a coincidence, and he will explain in his answer (unless one of our readers explains it first!) what 2184 has to do with one of the most remarkable theorems in number theory proven so far this century.

I also reached out to Matt Parker (check out his Festival Of The Spoken Nerd: Full Frontal Nerdity) and asked what led to his interest in this problem, and why he thought it made for such a popular YouTube video. Here’s his response:

Well, I largely have my parents to thank for 1980 as they timed my birth perfectly for it to be such a mathematically interesting year. I first came across this when I was reading about the mathematician Augustus De Morgan. He was born in 1806 and once set the puzzle to work out his birth year with the information “I was x years of age in the year x²” (and indeed he turned 43 in the year 1849 = 43²). I was curious to see what other birth years this would work for and was astounded when my own birth year was one of them! I think it has been popular because people like things that are based on birthdays and other significant numbers to do with their lives, and even people who don’t like math at all can relate to having a favorite number. So I like to take this kind of social attachment to numbers and use it to talk about some interesting number theory! When I was playing around with other such birth years for the Numberphile video, I accidentally spotted that 2184 + 3 = 3⁷ and 2184 + 13 = 13³. I had written some code to spit out all possible such years and noticed that 2184 was in there twice.

Thanks, Matt! And here it is:

Why 1980 was a great year to be born… but 2184 will be better

What kicked all this off for Dana was the original video by Alex Bellos about that World’s Favorite Number. Here it is:

I thought this was a such a great idea for a video, and asked Alex about it. What other numbers were popular besides 7? And what inspired him to make the video? Here’s his response:

The top ten: 7, 3, 8, 4, 5, 13, 9, 6, 2, 11. The overall pattern is that low whole numbers ranked best in the survey and the higher the number, the less well it ranked. With the following caveats: odd numbers do better than evens on the whole, round numbers do terribly, and numbers with nerdy or sexual connotations do well also.

I don’t have a favorite number, which is what inspired me to conduct the poll. When my first math book came out I was flabbergasted that so many people asked me for my favorite number, since I assumed that no one over the age of five has one. When I realized that many people do – I thought it would be fun to quantify.

Dana Mackenzie’s “Doubly Good Year” Solutions and Comments

The discussion on this problem started out fast and then slowed down considerably! In some ways this is characteristic of pure number theory problems: It’s easy to find examples and formulate conjectures but hard to prove them.

On my first question, Ravi from Hyderabad was first to answer that the next “good year” in Parker’s original sense will be 2070, and they occur at gradually (actually, linearly) increasing intervals after that – 92 years, 94 years, etc.

On the second question, when we allow any powers (not just squares), 2046 = 211 – 2 is the next good year. Steven Lord was first to mention this solution, and Jim from Savannah proved it was the next one by listing the next powers of the form xn – x for n = 2, …, 11. By the way, it might be worth pointing out that anyone born before 1980 who lives to 2070 will get to see three good years in their lifetime (1980, 2046, 2070) – not an easy feat!

Now let’s get to the crux of the column, the doubly good years. Steven Lord found several examples (with an assist from Abigail from Europe, who reminded him about 6):

• 6 = 23 – 2 = 32 – 3

• 30 = 25 – 2 = 62 – 6

• 210 = 63 – 6 = 152 – 5

• 240 = 35 – 3 = 162 – 16

• 2184 = 37 – 3 = 133 – 13

• 8190 = 213 – 2 = 912 – 9

A little bit later he added one more to the list:

• 78120 = 57 – 5 = 2802 – 280.

Of course, we will need some life-extension technology to be invented before the year 78120, so that the babies born that year will have a chance to live to age 280.

Finally, Abigail discovered the eighth (and largest?) solution,

• 24299970 = 305 – 30 = 49302 – 4930.

People born in this year, more than 24 million years from now, will have to live 4930 years for their second chance to see their age become a root of the year!

Abigail also suggested a cool modification to the original problem: fractional exponents! In fact, if we allow fractional exponents, there is a “good year” even sooner than 2046, namely the year 2032 = 16(11/4)– 16. Good work, Abigail! I encouraged readers to consider generalizing the “doubly good” question to fractional exponents, but I got no takers.

Now let me tell you a little history about the problem. It keeps popping up now and then. As I described in Gary’s column, Matt and I independently noticed the “doubly good” property of 2184 last year. Previously, a software engineer named Willie Wu had also noticed it and posted a question about it on MathOverflow here. He found the same eight solutions, and conjectured that there are no more. One of his readers, a number theorist named Mike Bennett, pointed out that he had discussed this same question (and found the same answers) in this paper published in 2001.

Interestingly, Bennett looked at a more general problem, which when you rephrase it a little bit is EXACTLY the question of finding “doubly good” years with fractional exponents. That’s why I was so excited when Abigail posted her comment! Bennett found three more solutions (written differently in his paper, but I’ll adapt them for our context):

• 24 = 8(5/3) – 8 = 33 – 3

• 120 = 8(7/3) – 8 = 53 – 5

• 6480 = 1296(5/4) – 1296 = 812 – 81.

Bennett conjectured that these eleven solutions (the eight with integer exponents and the three with fractional exponents) are the only ones.

This is when the hard part begins. How can we show these are the only solutions? I think it will be an extremely long time before we know the answer. Maybe by the year 2184 (the next doubly good year) we’ll have a proof that this is the complete list of doubly good years?

As a matter of terminology, I find the “good year” label to be a little bit vague, so I coined a new word and a new meaning for an old word. If n = xᵃ – x, I call n an “absurd” number because it is given by a number (e.g., 2048) minus a surd (or root) of that number (2, the eleventh root of 2048). So “absurd” would be Latin (sort of) for “without the root.” Likewise, a number n = xᵃ + x would be “adsurd” – literally, add the surd!

Actually, there is no distinction between absurd and adsurd when the exponent a = 2, so I would propose to call a number “strictly absurd” (or “strictly adsurd”) if a is at least 3. With this terminology, 2184 is (I believe) the only doubly strictly absurd number. That’s a conjecture – I can’t prove it. Also, I conjecture that 130 = 2⁷ + 2 = 5³ + 5 is the only doubly strictly adsurd number. Could anyone check this on a computer, up to a billion or so?

I was able to make a little bit of progress on the “2184 conjecture” in the case when the exponent a is actually EQUAL to 3. It turns out that the number 2184 relates to a wonderful (and underpublicized) theorem proved by Preda Mihailescu just over a decade ago, which itself solved a more than 150-year-old problem called Catalan’s conjecture.

2184 and Mihailescu’s Theorem

I will now give a rough explanation of why 2184 = 3⁷ – 3 = 13³ – 13 is the only doubly strictly absurd number, provided we add three extra conditions: the smaller exponent is 3, the larger exponent is odd, and the larger base (13 in this case) is prime.

For readers who are familiar with algebra, the argument starts out by labeling our unknowns as x, y, and a: xᵃ – x = y³ – y. However, for those who are not comfortable with algebra, I will simply start with the solution that we know and reduce it to a smaller solution to a simpler equation. I will then explain how this procedure would work in general.

Thus, we begin with 3⁷ – 3 = 13³ – 13. The first step is to multiply both sides by a power of 3 that is sufficient to make the left-hand side have the form “something cubed minus something.” Multiplying by 3² works:

27³ – 27 = 3⁹ – 3³ = 3² (3⁷ – 3) = 3² (13³ – 13)

The left-hand side splits into factors as 26 × 27 × 28. Because 13 is prime, it must be a divisor of one of those factors, and in fact we see that 26 = 2 × 13.

Now comes a part of the argument that your high-school algebra teacher would not like at all. I want to point out that 27 is much smaller than 27³ and 13 is much smaller than 13³. So it will “not matter too much” if we just ignore the first powers, and it will also “not matter too much” if we replace 27 by 26. So allowing for some inaccuracy, we have

2³ (13³) ≈ 26³ ≈ 27³ – 27 = 3² (13³ – 13) ≈ 3² (13³)

Dividing through by 13³, we conclude that

2³ = 3²

which is of course true in a certain sense because 2³ = 3² – 1.

At this point you might be saying, “So what?” We started with one true statement (3⁷ – 3 = 13³ – 13) and ended with another true statement (2³ = 3² – 1). But the key point is that this argument is completely general. When we start with unknown values of x, y, and a, we can go through the exact same steps to derive auxiliary variables k (i.e., the “correct power of x that makes the left-hand side look like something cubed minus something”) and j (i.e., the “multiple of y that equals something plus or minus one”). In the above argument, both j and k were 2. And when I do the “approximately equals” part of the argument carefully, I can show that either

0 < xᵏ – j³ < 2 or 0 < j³ – xᵏ < 2.

But here’s the catch! Everything in sight is a whole number, and the only whole number between 0 and 2 is 1! So the above inequalities can be reduced to an equality:

xᵏ – j³ = ±1.

In other words, xᵏ and j³ are two consecutive whole numbers that both happen to be powers.

Maybe this doesn’t shock you too much. After all, we have already seen one example: 2³ (= 8) and 3² (= 9) are consecutive numbers that are powers. Very good. Now I challenge you: Find the next example. Go ahead. Take an hour, or a day, or a century. Put your best and fastest supercomputer on the problem.

Give up? That’s good, because there are no other examples. Among the whole vast, infinite universe of whole numbers, 8 and 9 are the only two that are consecutive powers. This astounding fact was proven in 2002 by Preda Mihailescu (though it was already conjectured to be true 160 years earlier, by Eugene Catalan). If you want to understand Mihailescu’s proof, look up Catalan’s Conjecture by Rene Schoof (2008). (But you will have to learn some pretty sophisticated number theory.)

So we have established a connection between consecutive powers (8 and 9) and solutions to the equation xᵃ – x = y³ – y with y a prime number (x = 3 and y = 13). There is only one example of the former, and therefore there can only be one example of the latter, namely xᵃ – x = y³ – y = 2184. Thus 2184, too, is a unique number in the whole universe.

What I love about this problem is that it’s a recreational number theory problem that is solvable and that connects up to a major recent result in “academic” number theory. In my experience, it is frustratingly rare to find a problem where academic number theory can be brought to bear on a recreational problem, so I was thrilled to find this one.

The only thing that I find just slightly disappointing is that we needed to assume y is prime. There still could be some numbers a, x, and y out there such that xᵃ – x = y³ – y and y is a composite number. I don’t believe it, but I will have to throw the question open to the readers!",https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/04/the-doubly-good-year/

I don’t have a favorite number, which is what inspired me to conduct the poll. When my first math book came out I was flabbergasted that so many people asked me for my favorite number, since I assumed that no one over the age of five has one. When I realized that many people do – I thought it would be fun to quantify.

Dana Mackenzie’s “Doubly Good Year” Solutions and Comments

The discussion on this problem started out fast and then slowed down considerably! In some ways this is characteristic of pure number theory problems: It’s easy to find examples and formulate conjectures but hard to prove them.

On my first question, Ravi from Hyderabad was first to answer that the next “good year” in Parker’s original sense will be 2070, and they occur at gradually (actually, linearly) increasing intervals after that – 92 years, 94 years, etc.

On the second question, when we allow any powers (not just squares), 2046 = 211 – 2 is the next good year. Steven Lord was first to mention this solution, and Jim from Savannah proved it was the next one by listing the next powers of the form xn – x for n = 2, …, 11. By the way, it might be worth pointing out that anyone born before 1980 who lives to 2070 will get to see three good years in their lifetime (1980, 2046, 2070) – not an easy feat!

Now let’s get to the crux of the column, the doubly good years. Steven Lord found several examples (with an assist from Abigail from Europe, who reminded him about 6):

• 6 = 23 – 2 = 32 – 3

• 30 = 25 – 2 = 62 – 6

• 210 = 63 – 6 = 152 – 5

• 240 = 35 – 3 = 162 – 16

• 2184 = 37 – 3 = 133 – 13

• 8190 = 213 – 2 = 912 – 9

A little bit later he added one more to the list:

• 78120 = 57 – 5 = 2802 – 280.

Of course, we will need some life-extension technology to be invented before the year 78120, so that the babies born that year will have a chance to live to age 280.

Finally, Abigail discovered the eighth (and largest?) solution,

• 24299970 = 305 – 30 = 49302 – 4930.

People born in this year, more than 24 million years from now, will have to live 4930 years for their second chance to see their age become a root of the year!

Abigail also suggested a cool modification to the original problem: fractional exponents! In fact, if we allow fractional exponents, there is a “good year” even sooner than 2046, namely the year 2032 = 16(11/4)– 16. Good work, Abigail! I encouraged readers to consider generalizing the “doubly good” question to fractional exponents, but I got no takers.

Now let me tell you a little history about the problem. It keeps popping up now and then. As I described in Gary’s column, Matt and I independently noticed the “doubly good” property of 2184 last year. Previously, a software engineer named Willie Wu had also noticed it and posted a question about it on MathOverflow here. He found the same eight solutions, and conjectured that there are no more. One of his readers, a number theorist named Mike Bennett, pointed out that he had discussed this same question (and found the same answers) in this paper published in 2001.

Interestingly, Bennett looked at a more general problem, which when you rephrase it a little bit is EXACTLY the question of finding “doubly good” years with fractional exponents. That’s why I was so excited when Abigail posted her comment! Bennett found three more solutions (written differently in his paper, but I’ll adapt them for our context):

• 24 = 8(5/3) – 8 = 33 – 3

• 120 = 8(7/3) – 8 = 53 – 5

• 6480 = 1296(5/4) – 1296 = 812 – 81.

Bennett conjectured that these eleven solutions (the eight with integer exponents and the three with fractional exponents) are the only ones.

This is when the hard part begins. How can we show these are the only solutions? I think it will be an extremely long time before we know the answer. Maybe by the year 2184 (the next doubly good year) we’ll have a proof that this is the complete list of doubly good years?

As a matter of terminology, I find the “good year” label to be a little bit vague, so I coined a new word and a new meaning for an old word. If n = xᵃ – x, I call n an “absurd” number because it is given by a number (e.g., 2048) minus a surd (or root) of that number (2, the eleventh root of 2048). So “absurd” would be Latin (sort of) for “without the root.” Likewise, a number n = xᵃ + x would be “adsurd” – literally, add the surd!

Actually, there is no distinction between absurd and adsurd when the exponent a = 2, so I would propose to call a number “strictly absurd” (or “strictly adsurd”) if a is at least 3. With this terminology, 2184 is (I believe) the only doubly strictly absurd number. That’s a conjecture – I can’t prove it. Also, I conjecture that 130 = 2⁷ + 2 = 5³ + 5 is the only doubly strictly adsurd number. Could anyone check this on a computer, up to a billion or so?

I was able to make a little bit of progress on the “2184 conjecture” in the case when the exponent a is actually EQUAL to 3. It turns out that the number 2184 relates to a wonderful (and underpublicized) theorem proved by Preda Mihailescu just over a decade ago, which itself solved a more than 150-year-old problem called Catalan’s conjecture.

2184 and Mihailescu’s Theorem

I will now give a rough explanation of why 2184 = 3⁷ – 3 = 13³ – 13 is the only doubly strictly absurd number, provided we add three extra conditions: the smaller exponent is 3, the larger exponent is odd, and the larger base (13 in this case) is prime.

For readers who are familiar with algebra, the argument starts out by labeling our unknowns as x, y, and a: xᵃ – x = y³ – y. However, for those who are not comfortable with algebra, I will simply start with the solution that we know and reduce it to a smaller solution to a simpler equation. I will then explain how this procedure would work in general.

Thus, we begin with 3⁷ – 3 = 13³ – 13. The first step is to multiply both sides by a power of 3 that is sufficient to make the left-hand side have the form “something cubed minus something.” Multiplying by 3² works:

27³ – 27 = 3⁹ – 3³ = 3² (3⁷ – 3) = 3² (13³ – 13)

The left-hand side splits into factors as 26 × 27 × 28. Because 13 is prime, it must be a divisor of one of those factors, and in fact we see that 26 = 2 × 13.

Now comes a part of the argument that your high-school algebra teacher would not like at all. I want to point out that 27 is much smaller than 27³ and 13 is much smaller than 13³. So it will “not matter too much” if we just ignore the first powers, and it will also “not matter too much” if we replace 27 by 26. So allowing for some inaccuracy, we have

2³ (13³) ≈ 26³ ≈ 27³ – 27 = 3² (13³ – 13) ≈ 3² (13³)

Dividing through by 13³, we conclude that

2³ = 3²

which is of course true in a certain sense because 2³ = 3² – 1.

At this point you might be saying, “So what?” We started with one true statement (3⁷ – 3 = 13³ – 13) and ended with another true statement (2³ = 3² – 1). But the key point is that this argument is completely general. When we start with unknown values of x, y, and a, we can go through the exact same steps to derive auxiliary variables k (i.e., the “correct power of x that makes the left-hand side look like something cubed minus something”) and j (i.e., the “multiple of y that equals something plus or minus one”). In the above argument, both j and k were 2. And when I do the “approximately equals” part of the argument carefully, I can show that either

0 < xᵏ – j³ < 2 or 0 < j³ – xᵏ < 2.

But here’s the catch! Everything in sight is a whole number, and the only whole number between 0 and 2 is 1! So the above inequalities can be reduced to an equality:

xᵏ – j³ = ±1.

In other words, xᵏ and j³ are two consecutive whole numbers that both happen to be powers.

Maybe this doesn’t shock you too much. After all, we have already seen one example: 2³ (= 8) and 3² (= 9) are consecutive numbers that are powers. Very good. Now I challenge you: Find the next example. Go ahead. Take an hour, or a day, or a century. Put your best and fastest supercomputer on the problem.

Give up? That’s good, because there are no other examples. Among the whole vast, infinite universe of whole numbers, 8 and 9 are the only two that are consecutive powers. This astounding fact was proven in 2002 by Preda Mihailescu (though it was already conjectured to be true 160 years earlier, by Eugene Catalan). If you want to understand Mihailescu’s proof, look up Catalan’s Conjecture by Rene Schoof (2008). (But you will have to learn some pretty sophisticated number theory.)

So we have established a connection between consecutive powers (8 and 9) and solutions to the equation xᵃ – x = y³ – y with y a prime number (x = 3 and y = 13). There is only one example of the former, and therefore there can only be one example of the latter, namely xᵃ – x = y³ – y = 2184. Thus 2184, too, is a unique number in the whole universe.

What I love about this problem is that it’s a recreational number theory problem that is solvable and that connects up to a major recent result in “academic” number theory. In my experience, it is frustratingly rare to find a problem where academic number theory can be brought to bear on a recreational problem, so I was thrilled to find this one.

The only thing that I find just slightly disappointing is that we needed to assume y is prime. There still could be some numbers a, x, and y out there such that xᵃ – x = y³ – y and y is a composite number. I don’t believe it, but I will have to throw the question open to the readers!",https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/04/the-doubly-good-year/

This week’s main feature was suggested by Dana Mackenzie, the regular Numberplay contributor, chess champion, hula enthusiast and award-winning mathematics writer. Here’s Dana kicking off the year with —

The Doubly Good Year

On the popular “Numberphile” YouTube channel, the comedian-mathematician Matt Parker recorded an amusing video called “Why 1980 was a great year to be born… but 2184 will be better.” Matt explains that for people who (like him) were born in 1980, when they get to 45 years old their age (45) will be the square root of the year (2025). Surprisingly, this behavior is rather uncommon.

Our first question: When will be the next “good year” like 1980? What if, instead of square roots, we allow any perfect root?

When he was playing around with this first question, Matt noticed an amazing thing: For people born in 2184, there will actually be two occasions to celebrate! First, when they get to 3 years old their age will be the 7th root of the year (2187). Then, in case they miss this great occasion, they will have another opportunity 10 years later, when their age (13) will be the cube root of the year (2197).

Naturally, this invites our second question: Are there any other years with this “doubly good” property?

That concludes The Doubly Good Year. I asked Dana to say a bit more about the puzzle, and it seems he stumbled upon the remarkable year 2184 independently from Matt. Here’s Dana:

In 2014, Alex Bellos came out with a new book with a chapter about “The World’s Favorite Number,” which he determined by a poll of more than 30,000 people. No surprise, the world’s favorite number was 7. I wrote an article about his poll, and realized that I didn’t personally have a favorite number. (I suspect that many mathematicians wouldn’t.) I wondered, “What should my favorite number be?” My first thought was 24, which has some wonderful geometric properties. However, I suspected that this was a very common choice. My second thought was 130, which is equal to both 5³ + 5 and 2⁷ + 2. I immediately suspected that this was the largest such number, and did a little bit of playing around with small powers to make sure there weren’t any other obvious examples. That’s when I stumbled on 2184, which has the very similar property of being equal to both 3⁷ – 3 and 13³ – 13.

The fact that 2184 has this property really floored me. Why? Richard Guy’s “Strong Law of Small Numbers” says that “There aren’t enough small numbers to meet the many demands made of them.” So some coincidences are inevitable. To me, 130 is almost small enough that it could be just a coincidence that it equals both 5³ + 5 and 2⁷ + 2. It’s surprising, but not startling. But to my thinking, 2184 is no longer a small number. And for it to be equal to both 3⁷ – 3 and 13³ – 13, spot on… I felt that there had to be a reason for this. It couldn’t be just coincidence.

Thanks, Dana! In fact, Dana assures us that this is not a coincidence, and he will explain in his answer (unless one of our readers explains it first!) what 2184 has to do with one of the most remarkable theorems in number theory proven so far this century.

I also reached out to Matt Parker (check out his Festival Of The Spoken Nerd: Full Frontal Nerdity) and asked what led to his interest in this problem, and why he thought it made for such a popular YouTube video. Here’s his response:

Well, I largely have my parents to thank for 1980 as they timed my birth perfectly for it to be such a mathematically interesting year. I first came across this when I was reading about the mathematician Augustus De Morgan. He was born in 1806 and once set the puzzle to work out his birth year with the information “I was x years of age in the year x²” (and indeed he turned 43 in the year 1849 = 43²). I was curious to see what other birth years this would work for and was astounded when my own birth year was one of them! I think it has been popular because people like things that are based on birthdays and other significant numbers to do with their lives, and even people who don’t like math at all can relate to having a favorite number. So I like to take this kind of social attachment to numbers and use it to talk about some interesting number theory! When I was playing around with other such birth years for the Numberphile video, I accidentally spotted that 2184 + 3 = 3⁷ and 2184 + 13 = 13³. I had written some code to spit out all possible such years and noticed that 2184 was in there twice.

Thanks, Matt! And here it is:

Why 1980 was a great year to be born… but 2184 will be better

What kicked all this off for Dana was the original video by Alex Bellos about that World’s Favorite Number. Here it is:

I thought this was a such a great idea for a video, and asked Alex about it. What other numbers were popular besides 7? And what inspired him to make the video? Here’s his response:

The top ten: 7, 3, 8, 4, 5, 13, 9, 6, 2, 11. The overall pattern is that low whole numbers ranked best in the survey and the higher the number, the less well it ranked. With the following caveats: odd numbers do better than evens on the whole, round numbers do terribly, and numbers with nerdy or sexual connotations do well also.

I don’t have a favorite number, which is what inspired me to conduct the poll. When my first math book came out I was flabbergasted that so many people asked me for my favorite number, since I assumed that no one over the age of five has one. When I realized that many people do – I thought it would be fun to quantify.

Potholed roads and even the city’s superhighways are crowded with traffic, overloaded vendors, earsplitting noise, choking pollution, piercing colors and powerful smells. Extreme wealth is set against a backdrop of grinding poverty, hope battles despair, daily acts of kindness and generosity are offset by cruelty, greed and corruption, and creativity is inspired by necessity because of the city’s broken infrastructure and the looming threat of ruin. Between these extremes, and usually to the background drone of a generator, exist the rich and textured lives of some 20 million people.

Lagos is long overdue for a book that captures this kaleidoscope of random energy, disorder and color. “Africa Under the Prism,” just published by Hatje Cantz, gathers work shown during the first five years of LagosPhoto, an international arts festival begun in 2010 to reflect African perspectives and realities.

The festival’s aim is to challenge Afro-pessimism and the visual overrepresentation of Africa as a continent of the dying, desperate and helpless. It recently held its sixth edition, and much of the festival’s success rests on its ability to tap into the creative vibe of Africa’s most populous city. While “Africa Under the Prism” features works by Nigerian photographers shooting in Lagos, the book’s content spans the breadth of the continent.

“It is easy to expect the book to be representative of Lagos, but it’s really a chronological sequence of the work we have done with the festival over the years, and not a book about Lagos,” the festival founder and director Azu Nwagbogu said.

As such, it mirrors the evolution from the festival’s early days of African photographers telling African stories to more expansive conceptual work, and the inclusion of projects that were rarely seen in Africa, like the Dutch photographer Kadir van Lohuizen’s “Diamond Matters,” which charts the diamond trade from excavation in Africa to markets overseas.

The result is a record — at times uneven — of a particular period in African photography. Long gone is the homogeneous colonial gaze portraying the “civilizing” work of exploitative European empires, as is the image of the noble savage. Western media tropes are also challenged. With the spread of digital technology and the growth of Internet access on the continent, we now have insight into the complex inner lives of “subjects” once observed only from the outside. This self-expression broadens the filter through which we view a diverse continent.

Some of the book’s stronger work explores identity in projects such as the South African photographer Mary Sibande’s “Long Live the Dead Queen,” a series of self-portraits featuring her alter ego, a domestic worker, dressed in striking blue outfits against a stark white background, and the Nigerian photographer Jenevieve Aken’s “Masked Woman,” another self-portrait series revealing Ms. Aken, a former model, performing the role of a femme fatale in a black-and-white examination of women’s roles in Nigeria.

The Zimbabwean artist Kudzanai Chiurai’s “State of the Nation” features hyperstylized, ultrachromatic scenes probing how conflict can give birth to something else, even the possibility of a female head of state. “Flamboya,” by the Dutch artist Viviane Sassen, offers dreamy and seductive images that speak to the legacy of an imperialist aesthetic reimagined through a combination of documentary and staged photography that offers a fresh view of modern Africa.

The quality of these and other projects featured in the book highlights a weakness: With a few notable exceptions, the work from Lagos is the least accomplished, meaning the festival has yet to capture the frenetic energy of its host city. This is an honest representation of the festival’s output to date, Mr. Nwagbogu said, explaining that a main objective of the festival was to address this gap by helping African photographers to mature through collaboration with outside artists.

Such creative growth means that a book about Lagos is finally in the offing. Over the years, established photographers invited to the festival, including Stanley Greene of the United States, Robin Hammond of New Zealand and Mr. van Lohuizen, among many others, have worked with a handful of Nigerian photographers to document the city for a book of combined work titled “Lagos: Entropy Unchecked,” to be published in 2016. Until then, “Africa Under the Prism” offers a glimpse at LagosPhoto’s past, and potential.

31,The End of Lawyers? Not So Fast.,2016-01-04,"['John Markoff', 'Topics.Nytimes.Com Top Reference Timestopics People M John_Markoff Index.Html']","The fate of lawyers has been seen as a harbinger of a broader wave of worker displacement.
Earlier, Dr. Autor had written about what he described as the limits of automation technologies.
Based on their analysis of actual billed hours, the researchers examined the work that lawyers do in broad general categories.
and automation technologies.
Artificial intelligence technologies will continue to wend their way into the workplace, but they are more likely to change work, rather than end it.","['technologies', 'study', 'lawyers', 'automation', 'end', 'work', 'technological', 'recent', 'researchers', 'legal', 'jobs', 'fast']","Lawyers have been described as the canaries in the coal mine in the face of a wave of automation now beginning to displace highly skilled white-collar workers.

In recent years, the increasing reliance on so-called “e-discovery” software in lawsuits raised the specter that $35-an-hour paralegals as well as $400-an-hour lawyers would fall victim to programs that could read and analyze legal documents more quickly and accurately than humans.

The fate of lawyers has been seen as a harbinger of a broader wave of worker displacement. The rapid commercialization of a new generation of artificial intelligence-derived technologies has led to concerns that technological disruption will extend from white- and blue-collar occupations of largely routine work that can be automated, into highly-paid professions like legal workers and doctors.

That has led to a new round of automation anxiety. Two Massachusetts Institute of Technology economists, Eric Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, and a Silicon Valley software entrepreneur, Martin Ford, have written several books among them — including “Race Against the Machine,” “The Second Machine Age,” “The Lights in the Tunnel” and “Rise of the Robots,” warning that rapid technological advances might wreak havoc with the economy.

Not so fast.

Despite the fears of some of a “jobs-pocalypse,” the economy has stubbornly refused to cooperate with the doomsayers. Last month, there were 149 million people employed in the United States, the most in history. And in recent months a growing array of new studies have indicated that the relationship between technological advances and job displacement is more complex and nuanced than pessimists have suggested.

In November, for example, a study prepared by McKinsey & Company suggested that adding technology to the workplace is more likely to transform, rather than eliminate, jobs. This echoed a growing consensus that it is important to distinguish “task” automation from “job” automation.

The McKinsey study found that less than 5 percent of jobs can be completely automated based on existing technologies within the next three to five years. Even more striking is a similar study by James Bessen, a Boston University School of Law researcher, who found a positive relationship between the degree of computerization in a particular job category and employment growth.

Those studies support another recent paper written by David Autor, an M.I.T. labor economist known for his research indicating that middle-income, mid-skilled jobs in the United States have undergone a significant decline in recent years.

But writing in the Journal of Economic Perspectives this summer, Mr. Autor posed the question: “Why are there still so many jobs?” He pointed out that automation just as frequently complements as replaces labor in the workplace. He predicted that in the future, while A.I. technologies would continue to replace routinized jobs, they would also increase the number of workers whose jobs require problem-solving, flexibility and creativity.

Earlier, Dr. Autor had written about what he described as the limits of automation technologies. The challenge for A.I. designers, he wrote, was embedded in the observation made by the pre-modern-computing era philosopher Michael Polanyi: “We can know more than we can tell …” In other words, there are many human activities that cannot be formally described. It is those aspects of human behavior that computers cannot be programmed to simulate.

That view is supported by a new study, “Can Robots Be Lawyers?”, a draft of which was posted last week on the Social Science Research Network by Dana Remus, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, and Frank S. Levy, an M.I.T. labor economist. In the study, they explored which aspects of a lawyer’s job could be automated.

The research suggested that, for now, even the most advanced A.I. technology would at best make only modest inroads into the legal profession. Based on their analysis of actual billed hours, the researchers examined the work that lawyers do in broad general categories. They then analyzed how much of each category might be displaced by existing A.I. and automation technologies.

As it turns out, being a lawyer involves performing a range of tasks, from reading and analyzing documents, to counseling, appearing in court and persuading juries. Indeed, reading documents accounts for a relatively modest portion of a lawyer’s activities.

The researchers noted that many of the tasks that lawyers perform fall well within what Polanyi defined as human behavior that cannot be easily codified. “When a task is less structured, as many tasks are,” the researchers wrote, “it will often be impossible to anticipate all possible contingencies.”

And current e-discovery software programs still require significant involvement on the part of human lawyers, they wrote.

In an analysis of actual legal work practices from billing invoice data, the researchers estimated that about 13 percent of all legal work might ultimately fall prey to automation. If that amount of work disappeared in a single year, it would be devastating, of course. But implemented over many years, this amount of technological change would be less noticeable, they said.

They added that even in the case of start-ups like LegalZoom and Rocket Lawyer, two sites that can aid in the preparation of legal documents, the impact of automation would more likely be in expanding into underserved markets rather than in displacing existing legal services.

Artificial intelligence technologies will continue to wend their way into the workplace, but they are more likely to change work, rather than end it. “Even where automation has made significant progress, its impact has been far less than the headlines would have us believe,” the authors of “Can Robots Be Lawyers?” wrote.",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/04/the-end-of-work-not-so-fast/

And, according to the Department of Agriculture, total agricultural production has slowed significantly since the turn of the century. We need another ambitious surge in agricultural science.

Consider the avian flu epidemic, in which more than 48 million birds were killed — 30 million in Iowa alone — because the only way to control an outbreak is to eradicate a farm’s entire flock. The Agriculture Department recorded only 219 birds that were actually sick with the flu. The $3.3 billion in losses have led to a search for a better method of controlling the virus than killing a farm’s flock because of one sick bird.

History has shown that science can solve the nation’s agriculture and food production problems, but to do so, the American system of food and agricultural research must be substantially reinvigorated. Research can tackle how to grow more food with fewer resources under increasingly difficult growing conditions. But this can be accomplished only if more of the brightest minds are engaged with enough funding to pursue transformative ideas.

While private sector research and development in agriculture have grown over the past decade and now exceed what is federally funded, this financing is focused on shorter term benefits. On the other hand, more than 80 percent of federally funded research is designed to provide the building blocks for long-term production increases to address the many problems we face in the decades ahead. These problems have been amplified by climate change and the demands of a growing global population.

Experience has shown that the best way forward is funding research through a competitive process, with projects selected through a peer-review procedure that excludes politics. There is a program in the Agriculture Department that embraces these tenets, the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative, and its research grants show great promise.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/04/opinion/we-need-a-new-green-revolution.html

Best line: The idea that the federal government should not hold the land permanently “is not really a legal theory but a political wish.” — Richard Pérez-Peña

The New York City subway, one of the most frequently used metro systems in the world, is a communal space that has its own rhythms and peculiarities.

As the 2016 presidential campaigns swing into high gear, income inequality is on the minds of many. Paul Graham, founder of the technology incubator Y Combinator and a polarizing figure in Silicon Valley, believes that economic inequality — especially the kind produced by start-ups — often reflects hard work and innovation, so we should not attack the imbalance but instead the problems people face on the other end of the scale, like poverty and a lack of social mobility. The essay has caused quite an uproar on Twitter among technologists and economists. — Mike Isaac

For nearly a decade, the defining characteristic of the tweet — the unit of communication on Twitter — has been its brevity: Users are restricted to 140 characters.

That may soon change. Twitter is experimenting with introducing a longer form of tweet, according to two people familiar with the company’s plans, in what would be another gradual move away from the simplistic design sensibility that the service was originally founded upon.

The project, which internally has been referred to as “beyond 140,” is still in its testing phase and is not set to be introduced until at least March, said the people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the company’s plans. Twitter has not determined what the final tweet character limit will be, according to people familiar with the discussions. One number that has been tossed around internally is 10,000 characters, the same limit that users have inside private Twitter messages. Another possibility could be 5,000 characters, these people said.

Re/code first reported the news on Tuesday. A Twitter spokesman declined to comment.

The test is another signal of the changes at Twitter under Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and onetime wayward son who was appointed chief executive last year after a multiyear hiatus from the company. Since his elevation to chief executive, Mr. Dorsey has tried to make Twitter more accessible to the masses, a problem that the company has struggled with for years, much to the consternation of its investors.

Mr. Dorsey has made clear to employees that as far as redesigning the product is concerned, no feature is sacred. Twitter has experimented with tweaking its reverse chronological timeline, for example, a move that drew some comparisons to the algorithmically curated Facebook News Feed.

That being said, the new character limit extension is not likely to look drastically different than what Twitter users are familiar with. In the new design, tweets will still appear limited to 140 characters in the stream, as has typically been the case. If the content of the tweet is longer than 140 characters, users can expand it with the click of a button to read further.

The idea, according to the people familiar with Twitter’s plans, stemmed from seeing the creative ways people work around the service’s current 140-character count. Some users post screenshots of large blocks of text, for instance, or so-called “tweetstorms” of multiple tweets in rapid succession, in order to circumvent the text limitations on the service. “Beyond 140” is an attempt to appease those users without completely disrupting the visual layout of Twitter’s current design.

Twitter has made changes to its look in the past. In 2013, Twitter started allowing photo previews in the tweet stream, a move similar to services like Tumblr and Instagram. Twitter years ago also allowed some linked articles from web publishers to appear in preview form inside of tweets.

Many Twitter users were quickly up in arms after news of the possible character limitation extension became public, tweeting their disapproval for how the service might change.

In a tweet containing a text screenshot on Tuesday, Mr. Dorsey appeared to try to assuage users’ fears that Twitter may change drastically.

“We didn’t start Twitter with a 140 character constraint. We added that early on for it to fit into a single SMS message,” Mr. Dorsey wrote. “We will never lose that feeling.”

For obvious reasons, they are also more likely to appeal to criminals and others trying to hide from the authorities.

The law will be clarified to consider not only how many guns these dealers sell, but also how quickly they resell them after purchasing them, whether they sell them in their original packaging and how much they profit.

The president is also taking steps to improve the functioning of the federal background-check database, a critically important tool that has stopped millions of sales of weapons to prohibited people since 1998. Among other things, the F.B.I. will work to notify state and local authorities whenever a prohibited person tries to buy a gun and is rejected.

If one of your New Year’s resolutions was to do your part against climate change, keep reading. Now you can — with your investments.

You’d be following New York State’s example. At the Paris climate change talks last month, the state’s comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, announced that the state’s Common Retirement Fund, for public employee pensions, will put $2 billion into a new investment fund created by Goldman Sachs that prioritizes companies with smaller carbon footprints. If that goes well, the retirement fund will put in more.

The Common Retirement Fund is the country’s third-largest pension fund, so it often makes news in the world of institutional investing. But this announcement is also big news for climate change.

Until a few months ago, most investors had to choose between two kinds of green. If they wanted to invest in environmentally friendly companies, they had to accept either higher risk or lower returns. “One of the biggest barriers has been lack of financial products,” said Jamie Henn, a co-founder of the climate activism organization 350.org. “The only green funds have been boutique ones with high rates.” People invested if they were dedicated enough to the environment to pay for the privilege. That kept green investing small and limited its power to change environmental practices.

That trade-off is vanishing. In the last year, investors have been able to put money into funds that mimic the risk and return on benchmark indexes, while slashing the amount of carbon emitted by the included companies. “We expect returns equal to — or we think could be superior to — what we get in the Russell 1000,” said DiNapoli, referring to an index of large American companies. “We’ll be assessing the returns, and make sure it keeps to the Russell 1000. Our goal is to put even more of our public equities into the fund.”

Goldman created the investment fund only for New York State. But similar funds introduced in 2014 or 2015 are open to other investors, although they have not yet attracted the capital to match New York State’s investment. And more are likely to come — especially after New York’s vote of confidence in a form of green investing that may become mainstream.

“Green investing” to most people still means divestment — selling stock in companies that produce fossil fuels, especially coal, the worst for climate change.

The movement for university divestment has been a great rallying cry and organizing tool for climate activism. As Bill McKibben, the co-founder of 350.org, said, it helps to revoke the social license of fossil fuel companies.

But even McKibben acknowledges that divestment doesn’t affect the stock prices of fossil-fuel companies — and it might not matter even if it did. The companies are so big that divestment has next to no financial impact on them.

It might be a very smart move for investors, however. In the short term, stocks of coal companies, and to a lesser extent, oil companies, are doing terribly. And while in the past , energy stock prices have been cyclical, that may no longer be true, especially with the new emissions goals countries just committed to in Paris. These companies are likely to leave large swaths of their assets in the ground. “Paris is saying that we’re moving to a low-carbon future,” said Mindy S. Lubber, president of Ceres, an organization that mobilizes investment and business leaders to fight climate change. “What is the financial strength of a Chevron or ConocoPhillips in the next 10 years?”

A second form of green investment is putting money into companies making products or services that reduce climate change: for example, solar- or wind-power producers, manufacturers of emission-cutting devices and systems, and companies that do carbon trading or energy-efficiency management. DiNapoli also announced that New York’s fund would invest some $1.5 billion more in its Green Strategic Investment Program, which already has $500 million in such companies.

This kind of direct investing in climate solutions is needed on a huge scale — Ceres calls for a “clean trillion” invested every year to comply with the goal of limiting the warming of the planet to 2 degrees Celsius. But it’s not for every investor. It’s risky — many of these companies are new and volatile. Despite the boom in solar energy, for example, American solar companies are being driven out of business by inexpensive equipment from China. And stock-picking comes with high management fees that cut into returns.

New York’s investment in Goldman’s fund is an example of a third way. The fund starts with the Russell 1000, excluding coal producers. Then it groups companies by sector, such as health care or information technology, and within each sector increases the shares of companies with the lowest emissions, and reduces those of companies with higher emissions. Goldman will periodically re-weight the fund to try to mimic the returns of the benchmark, but to do so in the lowest-carbon way possible. Goldman says the historical performance of the basket of stocks matches the performance of the Russell 1000 while reducing carbon emissions by 70 percent.

This is called index or passive investing because there is no active money manager trying to beat the market by picking stocks. Passive funds seek only to match the market, but they outperform active funds for investors 75 percent of the time, largely because the passive funds’ fees are much lower.

Goldman is following other asset management companies that have created passive low-carbon funds in the past year or so, including BlackRock, State Street, and Mellon Capital in the United States, and Amundi and Northern Trust in Europe. These funds were started with seed capital from United Nations, Swedish and French pension funds, the University System of Maryland and the McKnight Foundation, but they have yet to attract much follow-on investment. New York’s investment in Goldman’s fund is much bigger, and sends a confidence signal that is likely to be heard.

Why do these funds matter? First, because they could become very, very big. Second, all companies, not just energy producers, emit carbon, and burning carbon releases far more greenhouse gas than extraction of it does. So these funds use the market to encourage all companies to reduce their emissions. By putting money into the most environmentally responsible companies in each sector, they help those companies grow at the expense of less responsible ones, while creating an incentive for all to bring down emissions.

Green indexes are not new. FTSE had a version in 2001, and Standard & Poor’s started in 2009. But they are only catching on now. One reason is that we now have more than a decade’s worth of data about companies’ carbon footprints. The data comes largely from a nonprofit group called CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project.

Since 2003, CDP has been asking companies to provide information about their carbon emissions. CDP’s request for information to each company goes out under the signature of 822 major institutional investors. Requests go to every publicly traded company in the world, and many provide answers — 75 percent of the S&P 500, according to Paula DiPerna, special adviser to CDP North America, and companies that issue 55 percent of stocks traded worldwide. Although the information is self-reported, most of the responses have been audited, said DiPerna. For companies that don’t report to CDP, index providers work with environmental data analysts such as TruCost and Sustainalytics to estimate emissions.

Investors have long been able to choose indexes made of companies that are mid-sized, or companies located in Eastern Europe, or pharmaceutical manufacturers, or companies that are consistent with Islamic law. Now they can also choose low-carbon companies.

Can these funds be sure they will match the benchmark index? Nope. As every prospectus says, past performance is not a guarantee of future returns. But matching is easier to do with a low-carbon fund than with many other types. The portfolio is still broadly diversified, with carbon-efficient companies in each category. (Some funds exclude fossil fuel companies, and some don’t.)

Carbon-efficient companies, moreover, often outperform their less responsible counterparts; research that tracks companies over a long period found that those that had worked to improve their environmental, social or governance records did nearly 5 percent per year better than other companies. Other researchers found that these companies were less volatile and risky.

The Bush administration had changed the guidance to compel pension fund managers to consider only financial returns when choosing investments. Now investors are free to consider a company’s environmental, social and governance records, as long as they do not compromise their fiduciary obligations.

For many pension fund managers, environmental factors are financial factors. Climate change already costs the world — and its corporations — trillions of dollars. In the long term, there is no greater financial risk, and long-term risk is exactly what pension fund managers are paid to worry about.

Pension fund managers aren’t alone. One in every six dollars invested in the United States is screened for environmental, social or governance factors, and the number is rising fast.

S&P, for example, is now taking climate considerations into credit ratings, the investment research firm Morningstar is calculating carbon ratings for its mutual funds, and MSCI is publishing the ratings of all 160,000 indexes it designs.

DiPerna worked with the oceanographer Jacques Cousteau in the 1970s. In 1979 she documented coral bleaching due to warming oceans; she’s been working on climate change, then, for nearly 40 years. She helped to establish carbon trading markets in Chicago and in China. “But I have never seen anything more important than the mainstreaming of environmental issues in the economy as we know it today,“ she said. “It’s not enough for the vanguard to act. And the mainstream has caught up to the vanguard. The financial services sector is ahead of the discussions in Paris.”

Not everyone is as optimistic. “I would say segments of Wall Street are ahead of Paris,” said 350.org’s Henn. “But people in the corner offices still treat it as a boutique approach.”

He also said that New York State’s DiNapoli “hasn’t said he’s divested from coal. He still has a billion invested in ExxonMobil. He says he’s doing shareholder engagement, so it’s O.K. We say: you’ve had two decades.”

The green index funds, Henn said, are only a start. “They’re looking at which oil companies are better because they don’t flare as much methane. That’s good, but if you’re still drilling in the Arctic? You wonder whether New York’s entire fund should be invested in a sustainable way. What’s happening with the other $180 billion in an era when it’s 70 degrees in Central Park on Christmas Eve?”

Fast forward to today. Solar energy prices have continued to fall rapidly, twice as many Americans work in the solar industry as in coal mining, and last year one-third of new electricity generation came from solar power.

BUYOUTS | A new, insidious relationship has developed among private equity firms, the banks that lend them billions to fund their buyouts and the law firms that advise on these deals,

Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column. Typically, a bank making a loan to a private equity firm planning a big acquisition would hire an external law firm to scrutinize the loan and the transaction. Instead of allowing a bank to hire its own lawyers to vet a loan, many large private equity firms, including Blackstone, Apollo Global Management, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Carlyle, now require the banks to use their chosen law firms. The private equity firms will also pay for the law firm’s services. This is referred to as “designated lender counsel” and is the latest conflict-ridden practice on Wall Street. Bankers and their lawyers complain that the law firms assigned have little allegiance to them and might not have their best interests at heart, but the pressure to secure these big deals mean few are willing to publicly criticize the practice. In the past, each bank lending money hired its own law firm so each transaction was scrutinized by multiple firms. The private equity firm still paid the legal fees. Private equity firms now defend having designated lender counsel, saying that it saves clients from having to pay double or triple the amount in legal fees. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association had already warned about the use of designated lender counsel in the context of municipal bond offerings. It said that municipalities should disclose the practice in their bond offering documents, noting that “Any undue influence by an issuer, however, that calls into question the qualifications or independence of underwriter’s counsel may create risk to the issuer.”

MARKETS CALMER AFTER A TUMULTUOUS START TO THE YEAR | The fears that rattled investors on the first trading day this year appeared to have abated somewhat as markets were calmer this morning,

Amie Tsang reports in DealBook. The jitters did not retreat completely as Chinese markets experienced volatility in the afternoon, but European markets opened on a positive note. The Nikkei 225-share index in Japan finished the day 0.4 percent lower. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong closed down 0.7 percent. Afternoon wobbles in mainland China had the Shanghai composite index down almost 4 percent before recovering to finish 0.3 percent lower. The Shenzhen composite index dropped almost 5 percent before crawling back to end the day down 1.9 percent. The CSI 300 index of blue-chip stocks, which had plunged enough on Monday to set off a newly installed circuit breaker and halt trading, was up 0.3 percent at the close on Tuesday. In Europe, the FTSE 100 in London and the DAX in Frankfurt gained nearly 1 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.7 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.8 percent in early trading, after slumping 2.5 percent on Monday — its biggest one-day drop since early December. On Monday, Chinese stocks plummeted 7 percent after the renminbi weakened and a manufacturing report showed a sharper-than-expected contraction — reviving memories of sell-offs last summer that roiled markets worldwide, as Peter Eavis and Paul Mozur report in DealBook. The Asian sell-off on Monday had continued into the European and United States trading day, with the Euro Stoxx 50 closing down about 3 percent and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index dropping 1.5 percent.



G.M. INVESTS IN LYFT | The founders of Lyft, the ride-hailing service, imagined that the future of transportation would involve fewer cars on the road. Now a car maker is helping them reach that goal,

Mike Isaac reports in The New York Times. General Motors invested $500 million in Lyft, making up half of its latest round of financing. The funding values the start-up at $4.5 billion, not including the new capital. In addition, G.M. will work with Lyft to develop an on-demand network of self-driving cars, moving into an area of research to which Google, Tesla and Uber have devoted enormous resources. They will set up short-term car rental hubs across the United States where people can pick up a vehicle and drive it for Lyft to earn money. Daniel Ammann, the president of G.M., will join Lyft’s board. Car makers have been rushing to adapt as consumer habits have changed and the use of ride-hailing companies has increased. There have been partnerships between carmakers and auto start-ups before. G.M. teamed with RelayRides, a car-sharing marketplace, Ford struck a deal with Getaround, another car-sharing start-up, and Daimler has been experimenting with a car rental service. Mr. Ammann said that the deal was an opportunity, rather than a threat, as G.M.’s core profit came from cars sold outside the urban environments where Lyft primarily operates. By branching out, G.M. has a better chance of navigating the changing trends in car ownership and use,

Robert Cyran and Antony Currie write in Breakingviews. The hubs will give G.M. an extra market for its vehicles and the flexible approach aligns with part-time and multijob employment trends. Also, as Lyft is not the market leader, it makes G.M.’s hefty stake less expensive. It’s not perfect, Mr. Cyran and Mr. Currie write, but it’s a partial insurance policy against what could become existential threats.

High-resolution 4K TVs are hardly new. They’ve been around for a few years — and each year, marketers say this is the time to buy one.

Not so fast, says Brian X. Chen — even this year.

There is also the price of the TVs themselves. The cost of 4K TVs has dropped significantly in the last couple of years. But the price of these machines is still not cheap — starting at $1,000, and going many times higher — particularly when compared with a HD TV.

A tax on sugary drinks implemented in 2014 in Mexico appears to have had a significant impact: After one year, sales of sugary beverages in the country fell as much as 12 percent while bottled water purchases rose 4 percent, a new study found.

Public health authorities hailed the findings as the first hard evidence that a nationwide tax could spur behavioral changes that might help to chip away at high obesity rates. Some predicted that other countries that have been looking at Mexico as a test case would follow in the country’s footsteps and implement their own taxes on sugar sweetened beverages.

“There are many countries in the region and other parts of the world that have been waiting on empirical evidence from Mexico to determine whether to implement similar measures,” said Franco Sassi, head of the public health program at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris, a research and policy group. “I think this is encouraging for all the countries that have been deciding whether to use this measure. This is a demonstration that it works.”

Mexico’s obesity epidemic has attracted worldwide attention. Of the 34 developed countries that are members of the O.E.C.D., Mexico has the highest rate of adults who are overweight or obese — about 70 percent — and the highest rate of Type 2 diabetes. It also has the highest per capita intake of soft drinks, which account for 70 percent of the total added sugars consumed by the average Mexican.

Public health advocates in Mexico led an effort to levy a nationwide tax on sugary drinks in 2013, which was widely endorsed and supported by medical groups. After fierce debate and opposition from the food and beverage industry, Mexico’s government passed a 1-peso per liter sales tax on sugar-sweetened beverages that went into effect on the first day of January 2014. The tax amounted to a roughly 10 percent price increase on soft drinks, half of what health advocates had been calling for.

The tax was part of a broad anti-obesity program with other measures that also went into effect later in 2014, including healthier school meals, food labels with clearer nutrition information and a ban on certain junk food ads aimed at children.

To assess whether the tax had its intended effect of getting Mexicans to consume fewer soft drinks, a team of researchers from Mexico’s Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica, a federal health agency, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill compared sales data before and after the tax was implemented. Their study, published Wednesday in the journal BMJ, looked at purchasing patterns in more than 6,000 households across 53 large Mexican cities.

The researchers found that sugary beverage sales fell an average of 6 percent in 2014, and that the decline accelerated over time, reaching a 12 percent drop by December 2014. The decline was seen across all socioeconomic groups, but it was greatest among people who were low income, whose consumption had fallen 17 percent.

At the same time, sales of bottled water rose 4 percent. The researchers said they believed the increase in water consumption was likely greater because the study did not account for water intake from other sources, such as water fountains. Mexico’s government has pledged that it will use some of the revenue from the soft drink tax to provide clean drinking water to public schools in low-income areas.

The findings are encouraging but Mexico should raise the tax from 10 percent to 20 percent, the figure originally proposed by the public health community, said Dr. Juan A. Rivera, an author of the new study and the director of the center for research in nutrition at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica. The new research was funded in part by Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

“In the area of obesity prevention and control, there are not many examples of measures that actually work,” Dr. Rivera said. “But these findings suggest that the tax is working and that it’s reducing the intake of sugar sweetened beverages. This is really important for Mexico and for the world.”

The study was challenged by the beverage industry. William Dermody Jr., vice president of policy at the American Beverage Association, a trade group that has fought strongly against the tax, pointed to a recent study that found that the tax had “minimal effects” on overall calorie consumption and no impact on body mass indices. That study was led by the Mexico Institute of Technology and funded by ConMexico, an industry trade group that includes Pepsi and other beverage companies.

“This tax was sold on a claim that it would make people healthier and cause people who were obese to become not obese,” Mr. Dermody. said. “It didn’t. It can’t.”

“No single product is driving obesity,” he added, “and saying otherwise is misleading people and public policy.”

Dr. Sassi of the O.E.C.D. said that such taxes were not a magic bullet against obesity and that they would not be appropriate for every country. But in places like Mexico, where sugary drink consumption is alarmingly high and obesity and chronic disease rates are soaring, they are “a necessary evil” because other strategies do not seem to work, he said.

“Many governments have relied on soft measures like education campaigns and promoting messages of better nutrition,” he added. “But it’s clear that obesity keeps growing despite these soft policy approaches, and governments are realizing that they need something tougher.”",https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/mexican-soda-tax-followed-by-drop-in-sugary-drink-sales/

But in places like Mexico, where sugary drink consumption is alarmingly high and obesity and chronic disease rates are soaring, they are “a necessary evil” because other strategies do not seem to work, he said.

Another partner, David A. Handler, routinely spends time with the technology giant Cisco Systems, mulling over potential acquisitions and sometimes simply helping the company think through its quarterly earnings release.

These deal makers are well compensated for their work. Centerview reaped a $60 million fee for helping orchestrate the merger of Kraft and Heinz. It earned $40.8 million for helping Pharmacyclics sell itself to AbbVie in March. For helping Time Warner Cable secure a sale to Charter Communications, Centerview will make $27.5 million. It will receive $44.4 million for advising Salix on its sale to Valeant, and $32 million for helping Omnicare sell itself to CVS.

For these assignments and others, Centerview earned about $600 million last year, according to a review of public filings, a huge sum for a firm with just 35 partners.

To be sure, the big banks do all this and more. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase were again the top merger advisers last year, capitalizing on longstanding relationships with big companies and the ability to throw a lot of resources at complicated assignments.

They became interested in health care and oncology after watching several family members and friends battle cancer.
Flatiron’s growth has tracked the rising interest among health care players in personalized medicine, a practice that tailors treatments to individuals.
According to the National Venture Capital Association, investment in health care services more than doubled in 2015 to $720 million, and rose 60 percent in 2014 to $345 million.
Other investors in Flatiron’s latest round include Allen & Company, the Scottish investment firm Baillie Gifford and the health-care-focused investment firm Casdin Capital.","['investment', 'leads', 'flatiron', '175', 'medicine', 'company', 'investors', 'million', 'care', 'treatments', 'health', 'roche', 'flatirons']","Even with some recent wobbles in the start-up world, big sums are continuing to roll into technology start-ups.

Just a few days into 2016, Flatiron Health, a start-up that gathers and analyzes data on cancer treatments and sells software based on those insights, said it had raised $175 million in a funding round led by the pharmaceutical giant Roche. Flatiron declined to disclose its valuation.

As part of the deal, Flatiron gets more than money. Roche will buy several of Flatiron’s software products, which are based on subscriptions, in a move that is set to expand the start-up’s stream of recurring revenue and better position it for a future initial public offering. The partnership between the two companies is nonexclusive, and Flatiron can continue to work with other pharmaceutical companies.

“We plan to go public in two to three years,” Nat Turner, Flatiron’s chief executive and co-founder, said in an interview. “To do so, we’ll have to meet certain financial metrics, and this investment sets us up to do that.”

The deal shows that sizable funding rounds for private companies are continuing, even after some investors said last year that they were beginning to see a drop in the number of venture firms writing huge checks to start-ups. Mutual fund investors had started to mark down the value of their stakes in privately held companies like Snapchat and Dropbox.

Much like the ride-hailing company Lyft, which this week announced it had raised $500 million from General Motors, Flatiron is tapping a deep-pocketed corporate investor that wants to benefit from the expertise of a start-up. G.M.’s core business is threatened by changing car ownership patterns, a phenomenon it hopes to slow by teaming up with a potential rival to develop a network of self-driving cars and create short-term car rental hubs across the United States.

Like many other big pharmaceutical companies, Roche is dealing with threats to its core business from generic-drug makers on the low end. It is also facing a shift in the health care payment system, in which insurers are paying more for treatments when they have been shown to be effective. Roche, a major player in the oncology market, said it would use Flatiron’s data to bring new drugs to market faster, keeping its drug pipeline full of innovative new treatments for which it can charge a premium. Generic versions of those drugs will not be available for several years. It will also use Flatiron’s data to better match patients with the treatments that will be most effective.

“Flatiron has tremendous data that helps us understand how medicine reacts in patients,” said Daniel O’Day, the chief operating officer at Roche. “This is a long-term strategic investment, and the strategic collaboration benefits us. The value in the investment is not to generate a financial return.”

Mr. Turner said Flatiron was weeks away from finalizing its funding round in November when Roche said it was interested in investing in the company that he founded with Zach Weinberg in 2012. “It was clear that Roche would be a great partner and bring brand value to Flatiron,” Mr. Turner said. “We wrapped up the deal in about a month.”

Mr. Turner and Mr. Weinberg founded Flatiron with the aim of organizing the world’s cancer data and making it easy to analyze. The hope was that cancer centers, pharmaceutical companies and other health care professionals could create treatments faster and pair patients with more effective regimens when armed with information about how drugs performed in the real world. The company has about 250 employees and has its headquarters in New York City.

Flatiron’s two founders had previously started an advertising technology company called Invite Media, which they sold to Google in 2010. They became interested in health care and oncology after watching several family members and friends battle cancer.

Flatiron’s growth has tracked the rising interest among health care players in personalized medicine, a practice that tailors treatments to individuals. The aim is that personalized medicine will improve patient outcomes more quickly and help reduce health care costs in the United States, which now account for a significant percentage of the economy. President Obama said in last year’s State of the Union address that the health care industry should invest more in personalized medicine, and venture capital investors and entrepreneurs have flooded the space.

According to the National Venture Capital Association, investment in health care services more than doubled in 2015 to $720 million, and rose 60 percent in 2014 to $345 million.

Other investors in Flatiron’s latest round include Allen & Company, the Scottish investment firm Baillie Gifford and the health-care-focused investment firm Casdin Capital. Previous investors include GV, formerly known as Google Ventures, and First Round Capital. Mr. O’Day will join Flatiron’s board, and the start-up will use the money to improve its products. Flatiron has a raised a total of $313 million.

Facebook’s Oculus is finally offering clarity on how much of a premium a virtual reality experience will cost.

After months of teasing the introduction of its Oculus Rift virtual reality goggles, the company said on Wednesday that it had opened orders for the system, which includes a headset and controller devices, with a price of $599. That’s without a computer included — you’ll need a fast one that will probably cost around $1,000. The device begins shipping in March.

Oculus also said that in February, it would open orders for a bundle, which includes the Rift headgear system and a computer that is certified to work with Oculus, for $1,500.

“People have been dreaming about immersive high-end VR for decades, and we’re thrilled to share Rift with you this March,” the company said in a blog post, announced during International CES, the consumer electronics show now taking place in Las Vegas.

While $599 and $1,500 aren’t cheap, Brendan Iribe, the chief executive of Oculus, said in an interview on the CES show floor that he felt there was still a broad market for the Rift at that price. “It’s a premium experience at a premium price, he said. “It’s not that

much more than iPads and basically pretty close to a laptop.”

2016 International CES

Oculus is just one of many companies preparing to offer virtual reality devices this year. HTC, the Taiwanese manufacturer, worked with the software distribution company Valve to develop the virtual reality gadget Vive that will be released in April. Similar to Oculus, the Vive requires connecting to a powerful computer, meaning the pricing should be similarly high. The companies have not announced the price yet.

And Samsung Electronics teamed with Oculus last year to offer an entry-level virtual reality system, the Gear VR. That device, at $100, requires inserting a Samsung Galaxy smartphone into the headgear because it relies on the smartphone’s screen for video and its computing brains for running apps and games.

Many companies are marketing their devices toward gamers, but the companies are hoping virtual reality has a broader reach to everyday consumers. Chet Faliszek, a writer for Valve, said in an interview that he didn’t think the HTC Vive would be limited to gamers, partly because it involved moving around and making hand motions just like people did in everyday life.

“They can do all these very natural things,” he said. “That versatility and that ease of using things is what works. It’s easier to enter in than a game.”",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/facebooks-oculus-says-it-will-charge-599-for-the-rift/

The Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday said that about 181,000 drone users had registered in the two and half weeks since the agency began requiring registration of the popular machines.

The database, for recreational users of drones weighing between a half pound and 55 pounds, is intended keep owners accountable for their use of the remote-controlled flying robots that have prompted safety and privacy complaints. It was announced in November and opened days before Christmas. The database, which will cost $5 per user starting in two weeks, tracks the names, home addresses and email addresses of users. Drone operators are required to mark drones with a registration number given by the F.A.A. for law enforcement.

The agency had estimated that more than 700,000 drones would be sold around Christmas. It did not give updated estimates on drone sales on Wednesday, nor did it say how many users may not be registered yet.

But at a news conference at the International CES in Las Vegas, Michael Huerta, the agency’s administrator, indicated that many users had not registered their drones and said he recognized the difficulty in informing the public about the requirement. The Consumer Technology Association said at the news conference that it expected 1 million recreational drones to be sold in 2016.

“Now that we have set up the registration system, our challenge is to make sure everyone is aware of the requirement and registers,” Mr. Huerta said. Recreational users who do not register can face penalties of as much as $27,500.

Charged by Congress in 2012 to come up with first-time rules for the then-nascent drone industry, the F.A.A. had struggled with the order even as sales of drones soared and reports of crashes and near-misses with airplanes grew. Lax federal rules have prompted many cities and states to come up with stronger rules that have spurred clashes with the federal agency.

2016 International CES

Companies have clamored for permission to use drones for activities like land inspections, wedding photography and package deliveries.

Silicon Valley has been focused on the F.A.A.’s pending rules for commercial drones, which are generally banned. Mr. Huerta said commercial rules would be completed by late spring and would most likely allow people like farmers and real estate agents to fly drones with some restrictions. The rules may require that the machines be flown during the day, below 500 feet, and within the line of sight of the person flying it. Those rules, however, would still prevent Amazon‘s and Google‘s ambitions to one day use drones to deliver packages. The companies have pushed for the F.A.A. to allow them to fly delivery drones beyond the line of sight of an operator, an important rule that would allow them to send multiple drones from a warehouse and operate the machines by a centralized computer.

“A lot of our recent public focus has been on recreational drones, but we’ve also been working on a rule that will allow routine, safe commercial and other nonhobby operations of small unmanned aircraft,” Mr. Huerta said.",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/more-than-180000-drone-users-registered-in-f-a-a-database/

Like much of corporate America, Silicon Valley has long had a workplace diversity problem. That is leading to the emergence of a new job title: chief diversity officer.

On Wednesday, Pinterest announced its first head of diversity, Candice Morgan, and said it will launch two initiatives to introduce more engineers from underrepresented backgrounds into the field of technology.

Ms. Morgan joins Pinterest, the online scrapbooking start-up based in San Francisco, after spending nearly a decade at Catalyst, a nonprofit group based in New York that is focused on expanding opportunities for women in the workplace.

“Diverse teams — in terms of demographics and thought — outperform homogeneous teams on innovation and problem solving,” Ms. Morgan said in a statement. “I’ve spent my career advising major businesses on best practice in diversity and inclusion, and am thrilled to join Pinterest, a company committed to bringing the fullest creative potential to our product.”

Last week, Twitter said it had hired Jeffrey Siminoff, a former Apple executive, as the company’s vice president of diversity and inclusion. In July, Facebook made public a training program it provides to employees to help manage unconscious biases that may lead to prejudiced hiring practices.

But progress has been slow, with some critics saying that tech companies only took steps begrudgingly after being publicly prodded by civil rights leaders. The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson Sr., a prominent voice in the civil rights activism movement, and others have called for tech companies to publicly release employee diversity statistics.

In 2014, Google complied, and some other companies followed suit. Their data offered a stark portrait of the lack of ethnic diversity in employee backgrounds at some of the world’s most powerful technology companies. While many of the companies have pointed out the money and resources they have devoted to spurring more ethnic diversity, data suggests it has not changed much so far.

Along with the hiring of Ms. Morgan, Pinterest will pursue two new programs to encourage earlier entry for underrepresented ethnicities into the computer science field. One program, Pinterest Engage, targets college students considering computer science as a major. Another invites minorities with nontraditional tech backgrounds to apply for a year-long apprenticeship at the company, with the potential to join Pinterest full time.

“Our vision at Pinterest is to build a product that inspires everyone,” Evan Sharp, co-founder and chief creative officer of Pinterest, said in a statement. “To make this happen, we need to understand the perspectives and needs of people around the world.”",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/pinterest-hires-its-first-head-of-diversity/

Over the last few months, researchers from Pew have been looking at parents, teenagers and the Internet. They’ve looked at how teenagers live their lives online, and how they feel about that new (to adults) arena. Now, in a newly released report, the researchers are exploring what parents and teenagers say about how parents monitor teenagers online and, perhaps more interestingly, how they don’t.

In Parents, Teens and Digital Monitoring, Pew’s researchers asked parents of 13- to 17-year-olds about things like how often they talk to teenagers about acceptable online behavior, whether they can access their teenagers’ social media and other online accounts and if they do so, whether they monitor the websites their teenager visits and how, and if they’ve ever limited online access as a punishment. Given the peaks of worry we’ve reached over various questions of our children’s online behavior in the past (sexting, bullying, “Internet addiction,” privacy concerns) the result was a surprising level of national moderation.

When experts in technology and adolescent behavior weigh in on the question of how to monitor teenagers online, the consistent message is that talk is more important than tools. Spending time in conversation with children about how we live our lives online, from texting to social media to comments sections, search histories and online profiles, matters more than installing monitoring software. Starting at a young age and continuing as they get older, we need to talk about everything from Snapchat and Yik Yak to online pornography.

“I don’t believe monitoring software is a good idea,” said Marion K. Underwood, dean of graduate studies in the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences at the University of Texas at Dallas and a co-author of the report “Being Thirteen: Social Media and the Hidden World of Young Adolescents’ Peer Culture,” which accompanied the CNN documentary of the same name when I spoke with her in 2015 about “Being 13.” Instead, parents should invest their time in being an active part of young teenagers’ lives online, and gradually step back (but not entirely) as the the teenagers get older.

“Children who felt like their parents were monitoring their activity online were noticeably less distressed by online conflict,” Dr. Underwood said. Particularly early in our children’s online lives, we should also monitor, but openly. When we help our children learn to socialize in this domain, we help them moderate their own behavior, and also help them put the world of the Internet into context as just one piece of a much greater whole.

Parents who participated in Pew’s research seem to be doing just that. We’re talking: Over 90 percent of parents say they have talked with their teenager about what is appropriate for them to share or view online and how they should treat others there. Those conversations appear to be more frequent for parents of younger teenagers, and when it comes to more specific monitoring of websites visited, parents of younger teenagers are more likely to check on them than parents of teenagers aged 15 to 17; similarly, of teenage cellphone owners, parents of children in the younger age group (13 and 14) were more likely to know the password than parents of older teenagers.

Relatively few parents rely on technology to monitor technology. Just 39 percent of parents report using parental controls for blocking, filtering or monitoring their teenager’s online activities, while only 16 percent use parental controls to restrict their teenager’s use of his or her cellphone. That triumph of talk over tech may be in part because technology’s ability to help parents limit and monitor is still itself limited. Blocking software often blocks too much or too little, and many gatekeepers are easier for teenagers to circumvent than they are for parents to install. And, parents may be more interested in being aware of what their teenagers are doing online than they are in actively putting a stop to it.

Products like the new Circle with Disney, which can can provide a list of all sites visited by a particular device, track time spent (“Cole spent two hours on Netflix today”) or “pause” the Internet for an entire household or certain users, offer a look at what most routers will likely be able to do in the future, but they’re not yet broadly used. When they are, their most useful aspect will likely be their ability to inform the same conversations we’re already having (“An hour on Instagram? Is something up?”).

No matter how good the tools to monitor children and teenagers online get, talk will always remain more powerful. The goal, after all, isn’t to control our children and prevent their doing anything foolish or dangerous on the Internet, or even spending too much time there — but to raise adults who can control themselves.

But they know they have bombs that they believe can bring the world’s biggest nations, including their chief enemy, the United States, to their knees. At least we have nuclear weapons, and that makes us untouchable, North Koreans would often tell me when I was reporting in the country.

Twenty years of negotiations on dismantling North Korea’s nuclear program won the regime millions in food aid, fuel and other concessions before the deals fell apart. But in addition to possible windfalls the bombs may bring when it comes time to negotiate, the North Koreans have a domestic imperative for building nuclear weapons. Bombs bring the people together, and Kim Jong-un has a political need for his people to start the year off on a high note: In May, North Korea will hold a Workers’ Party congress — the first in 36 years — where observers anticipate Kim may unveil his most ambitious policy changes yet.

During the 2009-11 succession period in which Kim Jong-un was being groomed to become leader, as well as the early years of his rule following the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in 2011, the younger Kim was pitched to the North Korean people as a modern military strategist who was keen to use science and technology to defend the nation against perceived threats from South Korea and the United States. Nuclear weapons are the culmination of that vision.

They are also a power play within his own leadership apparatus as he seeks to bring the once-mighty military into the party’s fold and at times experiences resistance. His is a bold strategy that calculates taking power and resources away from old-school military leaders trained in conventional weaponry and diverting it to scientists and hackers focused on building a defense based on technology. It is a tactic designed to appeal to the next generation of North Koreans, who will serve as the fledgling leader’s power base for decades to come. Children, even in electricity-starved North Korea, love technology, and they’re being told that the scientific projects they love so much can eventually bring them national glory.

In North Korea today, children are being raised to see nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles as their future. Playground slides are built in the shape of rockets and emblazoned with the name of the long-range space launch vehicle widely presumed to be a guise for a ballistic missile. Murals depicting rocket attacks on American forces adorn the walls of elementary schools I’ve visited. There is no confusion in North Korea about the purpose of the rockets: They are very clearly portrayed to children as ballistic missiles. Nuclear weapons are as much a part of the national mythology as they are a part of the arsenal — and for this reason, it is hard to imagine the country will give them up anytime soon.

Trying to understand what motivates the North Koreans doesn’t absolve them of their defiance. But knowing how sacred nuclear weapons are to them helps us understand how high their price will be when it comes time to negotiate away their sole treasure. In the meantime, the country will continue to build better weapons and stronger bombs, celebrating every test and rocket launch like a World Series championship in the streets of Pyongyang.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/07/magazine/kim-jong-uns-generational-ambitions.html

They have been neither vulnerable to the moribund economy the rest of the country has grappled with over the last several years nor the policies enacted by leftist governments that have led the country since 2003. That is partly because Brazil has long had extremely high interest rates. Its current benchmark Selic rate stands at 14.25 percent.

The current deepening recession and rising inflation are increasing pressure on the Central Bank to raise the rate even further. While the Central Bank kept the rate unchanged at its last meeting, economists expect an increase when it meets later this month and continued pressure for more increases throughout this year. That is in part because, “Inflation will remain a key macro issue in 2016,” according to a research note published on Dec. 30 by Alberto Ramos, Head of Latin America Economic Research for Goldman Sachs.

That also means higher credit card interest rates. Many Brazilians already pay annual rates as high as 415.3 percent as of the end of November, up from 327.8 percent one year earlier, according to Central Bank data. Average annual credit card interest rates in Brazil have risen in 10 of the last 11 months, reaching 99 percent in November, up significantly from 74.5 percent in the same month in 2014, according to that same Central Bank report.

In contrast, Nubank has not changed its 7.75 monthly interest rate in over a year. It also hopes that being digital both reduces overhead and results in better customer service. Banks, after telecommunications companies, usually generate the most customer complaints in Brazil. That has helped its popularity here grow.

More than one million Brazilians have applied for the card and approximately 300,000 are on a waiting list while their credit history is examined, Nubank said in the fourth quarter of last year.

Below is a brief primer on some of the central issues at stake.

Q. How is a hydrogen bomb different from an atomic bomb?

A. A hydrogen bomb, also known as a thermonuclear bomb, combines hydrogen isotopes under extremely high temperatures to form helium, in a process known as nuclear fusion. It is more powerful than a conventional atomic weapon: It uses the energy released from the combination of two light atomic nuclei, while an atomic bomb uses the energy released when a heavy atomic nucleus splits, a process known as nuclear fission. American scientists developed the hydrogen bomb, which was first tested in 1952.

Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States are known to possess thermonuclear weapons. Whether the four other countries known to have atomic bombs — India, Israel, North Korea and Pakistan — also have hydrogen bombs is not certain.

Q. What, precisely, did North Korea announce?

After years of promise, some observers are calling 2016 the year that virtual reality goes mainstream.
Microsoft says that its HoloLens — which technically is closer to “augmented reality” than “virtual reality,” but potato-potahto — will also be ready soon.
But that doesn’t mean you’ll enjoy virtual reality in 2016.

Improving the watch will require lots of fundamental advances over a period of years — smaller, faster processors and radios; better batteries; better artificial intelligence and voice recognition, among other things. Can Apple provide all that? Probably, and if it doesn’t, some other smartwatch maker will most likely do it. But it won’t happen this year. It might not even happen next year. You’ll just have to wait.

Similar hurdles await every other next-gen buzzword. Take virtual reality. After years of promise, some observers are calling 2016 the year that virtual reality goes mainstream. The CES floor is littered with goggles that promise to fly you into worlds more interesting than your own. Oculus, the Facebook subsidiary, began taking orders for its much-anticipated Rift headset on Wednesday. Microsoft says that its HoloLens — which technically is closer to “augmented reality” than “virtual reality,” but potato-potahto — will also be ready soon. A decade from now, we may well look back on 2016 as the year virtual reality turned the corner from a futuristic novelty into a mainstream possibility.

But that doesn’t mean you’ll enjoy virtual reality in 2016. According to the graphics-chip maker Nvidia, your computer will most likely not be able to support most virtual reality devices. Even if you’re able to get them up and running, the first devices will be underpowered and expensive. The goggles might make you nauseated or give you a headache, and doctors are still figuring out the deeper ways that simulated reality may affect your psyche. As with new video game consoles or media formats, you can expect most of the initial virtual reality content to be lackluster or unsavory (not that there’s anything wrong with that). Don’t discount the time it will take everyone to learn how to use virtual reality — and the time it will take app makers to create software that conforms to how people begin to use it.

Similar advances will also be required to perfect self-driving cars and self-flying drones. Advances in A.I. will also power a set of intelligent assistants far smarter than Siri, some that don’t make you tear your hair out.

All this could be grand: A few years from now, if you believe the boosters in Vegas this week, many of us will be shuttling around in self-driving cars, regularly plugging into reality-defying virtual worlds, and adorning ourselves with smart jewelry that will seamlessly integrate our bodies with the Internet. Our homes will be connected, our drones will be autonomous and our phones will sizzle with artificial intelligence.

The price of West Texas intermediate crude fell about 4 percent, to $32.68 a barrel. The renminbi continued to be a sore spot on Thursday. On Thursday morning, China’s central bank set the rate for the renminbi at 6.5646 to the dollar, its lowest point in almost six years. “People are worried about whether they are using currency depreciation to stimulate growth,” said Steven Sun, head of China Strategy and Hong Kong and China equity research at HSBC.

TOP EXECUTIVE TO LEAVE MORGAN STANLEY | A shuffle at the top ranks of Morgan Stanley has led to the departure of Gregory J. Fleming, an executive once seen as the leading candidate to run the firm, Nathaniel Popper reports in DealBook. Mr. Fleming decided to leave after James P. Gorman, the chief executive, elevated Colm Kelleher to the No. 2 position at the company, according to people briefed on the moves. Mr. Gorman has made a series of leadership changes recently to improve Morgan Stanley’s profitability. The bank has been struggling with regulations and changes in the markets, and its latest quarterly results were disappointing. The trading businesses overseen by Mr. Kelleher took much of the blame for Morgan Stanley’s poor earnings in recent years. Analysts expect the securities division to announce a $150 million fourth-quarter charge for eliminating 25 percent of the jobs in fixed income sales and trading, Liz Moyer reports in DealBook. Mr. Fleming’s wealth management division, however, was considered as the strongest performing part of the company. It has been responsible for nearly half of Morgan Stanley’s revenue in recent years. Mr. Kelleher’s elevation makes him an immediate successor to the chief executive, but Mr. Gorman has indicated internally that he is hoping to work with Mr. Kelleher to find a long-term successor among the younger generation of Morgan Stanley executives. Mr. Fleming may find his skills in high demand, Antony Currie writes in Breakingviews. He may have missed out on some chief executive jobs such as running Barclays, but the board of BlackRock might consider him as a successor to Laurence D. Fink, with whom Mr. Fleming is close. Mr. Currie also suggests that Mr. Fleming could appeal to American Express directors, as its stock has dropped nearly a third in the last 12 months and it has attracted the attention of an activist hedge fund after losing a contract with Costco. America’s regional banks could consider hiring him, too, as he specialized in mergers and acquisitions while he was at Merrill Lynch. With the Federal Reserve showing more willingness to allow lenders to merge, Mr. Fleming might be able to put his old tricks to use, Mr. Currie writes.

Yet only a small number of 4K televisions include high dynamic range, and only a sliver of 4K content so far is encoded with the richer color profile. Amazon started offering 4K content with high dynamic range last year, and Netflix plans to begin offering titles supporting the feature this year, starting with its show “Marco Polo.” Those two features combined — 4K and high dynamic range — will probably be the game changer for television. But that is still coming later rather than sooner.

Right now, there isn’t much to watch in 4K on cable TV. Comcast in 2014 began offering its first 4K-capable streaming app, and this year the cable provider will release a new box, the Xi6, that also supports high dynamic range. Despite these efforts, a Comcast spokesman said the total number of shows and movies produced in 4K is “still pretty small.”

A telltale sign that it’s too early to buy a fancy television is you still won’t be able to enjoy arguably the biggest show on television in ultra high definition: “Game of Thrones.” Jeff Cusson, a spokesman for HBO, which airs the show, said the company had “no plans at this time” to begin supporting 4K content. So fans who were hoping to gaze at the pores of characters like Daenerys Targaryen this year are out of luck. Other popular HBO shows like “Girls,” “Silicon Valley” and the “The Leftovers” will not be offered in 4K either.

Over all, sales of 4K TVs are picking up, which should encourage content providers to make more shows and movies in Ultra HD. Amazon said that in 2015, sales of 4K televisions tripled compared with the previous year, though it declined to reveal underlying sales numbers. Samsung, the No. 1 TV manufacturer, said it hoped that 60 percent of its TV sales in the United States this year would be 4K televisions, up from 30 percent last year. IHS, a research firm, predicts that 34 percent of American households will have big-screen 4K TVs by 2019, up from about 10 percent this year.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/07/technology/personaltech/ces-4k-television.html

Its highlight is a series of drawings and photographs by Frederick Kiesler, the Austrian-American polymath whose Endless House — never completed — fused fine art, architecture, furniture and lighting design into a bulbous, unstable whole. Several artists here echo Kiesler’s theme of the house as a reflection of the psychology of its inhabitants.

He gave the transplanted movement a name — “The School of the South” — and designed for it a now-famous logo: the silhouette of the South American continent turned upside down and placed above the Tropic of Cancer, where North America was on conventional maps. And he explained the meaning: The South, as a font of creative energy, was the new North, or at least its equal.

Almost wherever you look you need to look twice, and consult a label, to fully understand what you’re seeing.

In “On Display at CES, Tech Ideas in Their Awkward Adolescence,” Farhad Manjoo writes:

It’s a cliché for journalists to whine about International CES, the annual consumer electronics show that brings gadget-hounds and billionaires like a nerdy plague upon Las Vegas this week. As many have complained — yours truly included — CES long ago devolved into a noisy parade of puffed-up announcements that usually amount to nothing. But if news from CES feels especially desultory this year, it might not be the show that’s at fault. Instead, blame the tech cycle. We’re at a weird moment in the industry: The best new stuff is not all that cool, and the coolest stuff isn’t quite ready. It’s not that today’s tech is terrible — lots of potentially groundbreaking ideas are just around the corner. In product labs across the world, engineers and designers are working to turn a collection of annoying buzzwords — artificial intelligence, virtual reality, wearables, the “Internet of things,” autonomous cars and drones — into products that we find irresistible. They are all pushing the limits of what machines can currently accomplish, and working to come up with business models that customers will stomach. In time, after years of experimentation and incremental advances, many of these technologies might become mainstays. … Over the next couple of CESes, there’s a good chance we will see a lot of devices that will feel not quite ready. Virtual reality will underwhelm, artificial intelligence will feel annoyingly unintelligent, and cars and drones that navigate themselves will seem safer when parked. There will be wearables you won’t want to wear and home devices that will make you want to buy a new place. “It will eventually cross that hump and become mature, but it’s not there right now,” Mr. Bajarin said. It’s unsurprising that early versions of new tech will be a bit flawed. But what’s unusual about the current moment is how many new, interdependent technologies are coming about at the same time. We’re in the middle of a grand cycle in technology — the revolution pushed by smartphones, social networks and ubiquitous online servers (that is, the cloud everyone talks about). Over the last decade, these three technologies have altered wide swaths of the business world, destroying and creating hundreds of billions of dollars in wealth in sectors as varied as media and transportation. … All this could be grand: A few years from now, if you believe the boosters in Vegas this week, many of us will be shuttling around in self-driving cars, regularly plugging into reality-defying virtual worlds, and adorning ourselves with smart jewelry that will seamlessly integrate our bodies with the Internet. Our homes will be connected, our drones will be autonomous and our phones will sizzle with artificial intelligence.

The general impression one gets is of a generation that is stressed, energetic, creative, skeptical and in the middle of redefining, and thinning out, the nature of affiliation. Its members have been thrust into a harsher world where it is necessary to be guarded, and sensitive to risk. They want systemic change but there is no compelling form of collective action available. Their only alternative, which is their genius, is to try to fix their lives themselves, through technology and new forms of social interaction, rather than mass movements.

Their attitudes toward Social Security perfectly reflect this stance. Most millennials expect to see no Social Security benefits by the time they retire. But they oppose reforms to take money away from older workers to distribute it downward. They just figure they’ll take care of retirement individually, often using algorithm-based investment vehicles like Wealthfront.

Politically, this means that millennials may lean Democratic, but unless Barack Obama (or Bernie Sanders) is on the ticket, they don’t strongly attach to the party and it is not clear that they will vote. They didn’t in the 2014 midterm elections. It could be they are more interested in improving their lives by having richer experiences, and not through the sort of income transfers that come out of Washington.

My own guess is that millennials will be a muted political force, at least in 2016. But there will be some giant cultural explosion down the road.

Move over Manhattan: Office rents in San Francisco have eclipsed those in New York’s costliest borough as the most expensive in the country.

A combination of the booming technology sector and tight supply of commercial real estate propelled average office rents that San Francisco landlords are asking for to $72.26 a square foot in the fourth quarter of last year, edging out the $71.85 a square foot in Manhattan, according to a new report from CBRE Group, a commercial real estate services and investment firm. The prices in San Francisco rose 14 percent last year, compared with 7 percent in Manhattan.

Not since the original Internet gold rush more than a decade and a half ago has the price of office space in San Francisco surpassed that of Manhattan, long the country’s most expensive commercial market. San Francisco’s supremacy back then proved short-lived, as the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000 wiped out many start-ups. The era of social media and sharing economy companies has brought a flood of technology companies back to San Francisco, including icons like Twitter, Uber and Airbnb.

Office rents could tumble again if the tech sector falters badly, and there are anecdotal signs that some companies are struggling. Sidecar, a San Francisco-based ride-hailing start-up, last month said it would stop offering its services. Investors have lowered the valuations of several so-called unicorns, private technology companies originally valued at over $1 billion.

Yet evidence of a more cataclysmic shakeout in tech hasn’t materialized yet, and until it does, the commercial real estate market is likely to keep humming along.

In a phone interview, Colin Yasukochi, director of research and analysis at CBRE, said about 29 percent of the occupied office space in San Francisco is filled with tech tenants, around double the percentage back during the height of the first dot-com boom. The growth in the tech sector overshadows all else in the city.

“The market here in San Francisco has been largely driven by the tech industry, which has really been one of the growth leaders coming out of the recession,” Mr. Yasukochi said. “Manhattan is more dominated by financial services firms who were not on that same growth trajectory coming out of the recession.”

The soaring cost of office space in San Francisco has added to other pressures technology companies in the city are feeling, including increasingly expensive housing. Rents for a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco are the highest in the country, according to Zumper, an online apartment rental firm.

Few technology companies are abandoning the Bay Area entirely because of the abundance of talent and venture capital there, instead choosing to open satellite offices out of state or to relocate to less expensive nearby cities. One such start-up, 99Designs, an online marketplace for designers, relocated to Oakland from San Francisco about six months ago.

Patrick Llewellyn, the chief executive and president of the company, said many of the start-up’s employees lived in the East Bay, where Oakland is located, and the company was able to find a far better space in the city’s Uptown neighborhood than it could in San Francisco. He said 99Designs could have afforded to pay the higher office rents in San Francisco, but the terms were onerous.

“Landlords are demanding seven-year leases at minimums,” Mr. Llewellyn said. “In the fast-moving landscape that is the start-up business, that’s a long, long time.”

It’s important to note that CBRE’s rankings are based on average rents, and one of the unique characteristics of the San Francisco commercial real estate market is how little variation there is between office prices in upscale and less-upscale neighborhoods, compared with markets like Manhattan. Mr. Yasukochi attributes that to a more flexible attitude toward workplaces among technology start-ups, which tend to be more concerned about space for bicycle parking and dog play areas than striking views.

In nearby Silicon Valley, there is also far greater variation in commercial rents than in San Francisco. The average rent in Silicon Valley as a whole is $52.92 a square foot, according to CBRE, significantly less than the average in San Francisco. But that figure encompasses towns like Milpitas, at around $20 a square foot, and the chic streets of Palo Alto, near the epicenter of venture capital and Stanford University, where the average office rent is about $100 a square foot.

The chart-topping office rents in San Francisco are also a testament to the city’s geographic constraints, crammed as it is into 47 square miles at the top of a peninsula. The technology scene to the south in the sprawl of Silicon Valley is now and will most likely remain far bigger.

Of the 172 million square feet of office space in the Bay Area occupied by technology companies, only about 13 percent is in San Francisco, with around 73 percent of it in Silicon Valley, CBRE estimates.",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/08/san-francisco-office-rents-pass-manhattan-as-most-expensive-in-country/

LAS VEGAS — Over the last few days, I’ve repaired a robot, driven a Rover across Mars and zapped objects with a laser gun.

I did all of that while mostly standing around in a far less interesting place: Las Vegas, where the International CES, the giant consumer electronics trade show, was being held. To escape from the artificial reality of Sin City during the show, I spent a few days trying out different virtual-reality headgear and applications to assess whether virtual reality was a gimmick or a lasting trend.

My verdict: Virtual reality is here to stay for the long term, partly because the content looks and feels great (and also because so many tech companies will not stop talking about it). Whether it ends up widely appealing to consumers depends on how the companies market the technology and whether they bring prices down for virtual reality devices.

In the near term, virtual reality will probably appeal mostly to gamers and tech enthusiasts, largely because of the high price of having a solid virtual reality experience in the home. Facebook said this week that its Oculus Rift device, which will be released in March, would cost $599, or $1,500 when bundled with a computer.

But considering the high quality of the early content and applications already made for virtual reality, and given the amount of cash that companies are investing in the medium, this is probably not a fad that will fizzle out like 3D television. Virtual reality companies said 2016 is the year that many consumers will try out virtual reality for the first time and perhaps be wowed, though it will not be the year that it reaches mass adoption in terms of sales.

“I haven’t had anyone yet try the Rift and take it off and say, ‘I didn’t get it, that’s not incredible,’” said Brendan Iribe, the chief executive of Oculus, in an interview. “Most people’s reaction is, ‘That’s probably the best thing I’ve ever seen in technology in my life.’”

Virtual reality has come a long way. Technologists have been tinkering with the concept since the 1980s, but the first mature virtual reality devices and apps only started emerging in the last three years. Oculus, which was acquired by Facebook for $2 billion in 2014, has attracted the most headlines. But plenty of other companies now have a stake in virtual reality, including Samsung Electronics, Valve, Jaunt, HTC and Fox Entertainment Group.

During my virtual reality jaunts at the trade show, I strapped on the Rift headgear, which connects to a computer, and looped the two controllers around my hands to test two applications. An app called Toybox places a user in a virtual playroom surrounded by objects that you can pick up and interact with, like ping pong paddles, a laser gun, a slingshot and fireworks. Another player can join you in the session, too, to hit the ping pong ball or shoot a paintball at you with the slingshot.

Fox Entertainment also demonstrated a virtual reality app it developed for Oculus to promote the movie “The Martian.” The app gives you the opportunity to be Mark Watney, the astronaut left stranded on Mars, who is played by Matt Damon in the film. The experience, which lasted about 20 minutes, consisted of seven scenarios, including a sequence where you use the hand controllers to operate a crane to load solar panels onto the Mars Rover. A less enthralling scene involved sorting potatoes by throwing them into different buckets. I was lousy at tossing the potatoes into the buckets, just as I am inadequate at throwing objects in real life.

HTC, the technology maker based in Taiwan, has also developed virtual reality headgear called Vive with the help of Valve, the games distribution company. Vive, which will be available in April, connected to a powerful computer to deliver graphics that were even more rich and intense than Rift’s. I tried a handful of apps, including Tilt Brush, a painting app developed by Google, which let me draw brush strokes in three-dimensional space, in what was a pretty mesmerizing experience. A game app, Aperture, placed me in a robot repair facility and instructed me to open drawers, pull levers and push different buttons to repair robots.

The hand controllers for both Rift and Vive took some time getting used to, but it felt natural to interact with objects on both devices. I figured out how to repair the Aperture robot and operate the crane in “The Martian” app without any help. Chet Faliszek, a video game writer at Valve, said the intuitiveness of virtual reality should open the medium to broad applications, not just games. “The applications and the different ways that they can be used are so diverse,” he said.

Rift and Vive had some major differences. Rift is designed for use while standing or sitting. Vive encourages you to walk around — there is a front-facing camera on the headgear to let you peek into the real world with the press of a button, in case you want to grab a glass of water, for instance.

Both devices had some flaws. Rift was difficult to wear on my face; I failed to orient the device to block out the outside world in a space under my nose (perhaps because I have a long nose) and a quick head movement made the headgear go out of focus and required a readjustment. Because Vive encourages moving around, I tripped over the cord a few times. With both devices, I felt exhausted and overstimulated after 20-minute sessions — virtual reality feels like media designed to be consumed in small doses, not hours at a time.

Oculus and Vive are initially targeting gamers with their products, and there are limits to the appeal of the systems. Consider the aesthetics of the headgear, which could be off-putting to everyday consumers. Both pieces of headgear still look freakishly sci-fi, like something out of a “Star Trek” episode.

When I pointed that out to executives of Jaunt, a company based in Palo Alto, Calif., that provides a camera and software for companies to produce virtual reality content, they presented a smartphone wearing a case called the Figment VR. The Figment VR, a Kickstarter-backed phone case, includes two lenses that pop out of the case so you can quickly view virtual-reality content on a smartphone screen.

Jaunt, which hopes to one day to become the “Netflix of VR,” believes that, at least initially, the smartphone, not fancy headgear like Rift or Vive, will be the key to mass consumer adoption of virtual reality.

“It’s all about smartphone technology,” said David Anderman, the chief business officer of Jaunt. “Everybody who has a smartphone in their pocket — quite soon that could be everybody — can play VR content.”

Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst, agreed with that prediction. He said devices like the Gear VR, a virtual reality headset developed by Samsung Electronics and Oculus, has more potential to go mainstream. The $100 accessory requires inserting a Samsung Galaxy smartphone into the headgear, relying on the smartphone’s screen for video. After the Gear VR accessory became available on Thanksgiving, it quickly became a best seller on Amazon.

Ted Schilowitz, the resident futurist at Fox who helped develop the virtual reality app for “The Martian,” said the smartphone had trained consumers to embrace virtual reality. Smartphones, he said, act as robots that are our virtual assistants — and now people should be comfortable with becoming even more intimate with virtual environments.

“What’s happened to our psychology, to our humanity, has set the stage for what’s going on,” he said. “We’re ready for this now.”",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/08/my-virtual-life-at-techs-big-consumer-electronics-show/

And look at what happened to Libya. That is why we will never give up ours.”

North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test on Wednesday, claiming that it had detonated a hydrogen bomb. The United States government disputes that, but one thing is clear: North Korea’s leaders still believe that nuclear weapons will prevent others from attacking them no matter what they do. This is fanciful. What the world needs is reality. North Korea must recognize the limitations and risks of its nuclear program, and the United States must recognize that an American response is necessary.

Many serious dangers come with being a nuclear power, and the North Koreans seem to recognize few of them. One is the temptation to transfer weapons, fissile material or technology to other states or terrorist groups. North Korea has a history of selling its traditional weapons systems. But the government must recognize that selling its nuclear technology could compel the United States to respond in ways that would bring an end to nearly 70 years of Communist rule.

There are other ways that the nuclear program makes the government less secure. Over the past several years, North Korea has degraded its conventional military capacity in order to pursue nuclear weapons. Under normal circumstances, a weaker North Korean Army would be welcome news to the rest of the world, but with a budding nuclear state it can lead to rapid escalation in the event of a conflict.

About a quarter of Malaysians — nearly seven million people — are of Chinese descent, offspring of a long-established diaspora. The Chinese began to arrive in great numbers in the 19th century as part of the British colonial government’s policy of importing indentured laborers to work in the country’s tin mines and rubber estates.

Last year brought the conclusion of the Malacca-Guangdong development agreement, designed to secure future cooperation between the Malaysian state and China’s most populous province across virtually every domain — from trade and investment to land reclamation to green technology and museums and educational institutions. Although China’s primary interest is in Malacca’s potential as a maritime partner — the state occupies an enviable position halfway along the Strait of Malacca, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes — the agreement also reflects how China’s interests are broadening beyond the traditional realms of trade, into those of culture and education.

The partnership is also calculated to appeal to Malaysia’s sense of history and identity: Malacca was the stage for China’s first significant commercial and cultural exchanges with Malaysia in the 15th century, when the Ming emperors forged alliances with the sultans of Malacca. More recently, Guangdong has been the province that has provided Malaysia with its largest number of Chinese immigrants, after the southern province of Fujian.

North of Malacca, in the city of Salak Tinggi in the state of Selangor, the Malaysian branch of China’s Xiamen University has just been completed. This is the first time a Chinese university has established a campus abroad and provides a clear sense of China’s ambitions. But the choice of Xiamen University, the seat of higher education in Fujian, also symbolizes the two countries’ entwined relationship, given that the university was founded in 1921 with funds sent to China from Malaya (as the country was then called) by Tan Kah Kee, an immigrant from Fujian who had made his fortune in the rubber industry.

Among Malaysia’s ethnic Chinese population, China’s influence on local tastes is perhaps most noticeable in the growing use and appreciation of Mandarin as a language of everyday usage, as well as a vehicle for popular culture among the young. In Kuala Lumpur, a city whose ethnic Chinese population is drawn heavily from a centuries-old Cantonese-speaking community with roots in Guangdong Province, Mandarin TV series from mainland China like “Red Sorghum” and “Reunion Dinner” are rapidly gaining in popularity at the expense of Hong Kong-produced Cantonese dramas that, until recently, dominated Chinese-language viewing in Malaysia. These shows, together with news and entertainment programs, which are available on a range of channels broadcast by CCTV, China’s official network, are often included in Malaysian cable and satellite subscriptions.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/08/opinion/a-cultural-revolution-in-malaysia.html

We’re the only advanced nation on earth that sees this kind of mass violence with this frequency.

A national crisis like this demands a national response. Reducing gun violence will be hard. It’s clear that common-sense gun reform won’t happen during this Congress.

Its highlight is a series of drawings and photographs by Frederick Kiesler, the Austrian-American polymath whose Endless House — never completed — fused fine art, architecture, furniture and lighting design into a bulbous, unstable whole. Several artists here echo Kiesler’s theme of the house as a reflection of the psychology of its inhabitants.

He gave the transplanted movement a name — “The School of the South” — and designed for it a now-famous logo: the silhouette of the South American continent turned upside down and placed above the Tropic of Cancer, where North America was on conventional maps. And he explained the meaning: The South, as a font of creative energy, was the new North, or at least its equal.

“Kodak essentially chose to ignore the fundamental shift in its market – until it was too late,” noted the 2016 Report on the State of the Legal Market, which described how Kodak failed to adapt to the rise of digital photography despite its early innovations in the technology.

That should be an “important cautionary tale” for the legal industry, the report said. “What once was a seller’s market has now clearly become a buyer’s market, and the ramifications of that change are significant.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/09/business/dealbook/law-firms-risking-obsolescence-report-says.html
111,Historian Group Rejects a Resolution Condemning Israel,2016-01-09,['Jennifer Schuessler'],"The resolution, which was debated at the business meeting of the group’s annual convention, was rejected by a strong margin, with 51 voting for the resolution and 111 voting against.
The measure had been submitted by the group Historians Against the War, after two similar measures failed to gain support last year.
“The American Historical Association has just spent a serious amount of time discussing the Israeli government’s violation of Palestinians’ right to education,” Mr. Gosse said.
“I don’t see how we as educators could possibly oppose a resolution supporting Palestinians’ right to academic freedom,” she said.
The conflict between Israel and the Palestinians “has been dividing thoughtful people of good will for as long as I’ve been alive,” she said.","['israel', 'palestinians', 'historian', 'rejects', 'historians', 'association', 'historical', 'american', 'organization', 'condemning', 'groups', 'group', 'resolution', 'professor']","ATLANTA — The movement among some scholars to condemn Israel suffered a setback on Saturday, when members of the American Historical Association, the nation’s largest organization for professional historians, rejected a resolution condemning what was characterized as Israel’s interference with the right to education for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.

The resolution, which was debated at the business meeting of the group’s annual convention, was rejected by a strong margin, with 51 voting for the resolution and 111 voting against. The measure had been submitted by the group Historians Against the War, after two similar measures failed to gain support last year.

The progress of the broader Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, known as BDS, among academic organizations has been steady, if mixed, since the American Studies Association voted in 2013 to boycott Israeli universities, causing a furor here and in Israel.

More than a half-dozen American scholarly groups have passed resolutions condemning Israel, including the American Anthropological Association, which endorsed a boycott resolution in November (it will now be submitted to the full membership), and the National Women’s Studies Association, whose membership approved a boycott in December.

While the historical association’s more limited measure was defeated, Van E. Gosse, an associate professor at Franklin and Marshall College and a member of Historians Against the War, called the outcome “a complete moral victory,” and hardly the end of the campaign.

“The American Historical Association has just spent a serious amount of time discussing the Israeli government’s violation of Palestinians’ right to education,” Mr. Gosse said. “This debate is not going away.”

The resolution prompted hot argument even before the convention, with supporters and opponents publishing dueling advertisements and other statements debating both its appropriateness and factual claims, as well as the measure’s singular focus on Israel. The four-day convention also featured several scholarly panels devoted to the issue organized by Vicki L. Ruiz, the group’s outgoing president and a professor at University of California, Irvine, aimed at putting the issue in historical context.

Discussion at the business meeting was contentious but civil. In an opening statement on behalf of Historians Against the War, Margaret Power, a professor at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, said that the resolution fell squarely into the group’s mission.

“I don’t see how we as educators could possibly oppose a resolution supporting Palestinians’ right to academic freedom,” she said.

But in the opening statement on behalf of Alliance for Academic Freedom, a group that submitted a formal objection to the resolution, Sharon Ann Musher, an associate professor at Stockton University in New Jersey, said that the resolution rested on “dubious claims” and that passage would tarnish the reputation of the association.

The conflict between Israel and the Palestinians “has been dividing thoughtful people of good will for as long as I’ve been alive,” she said. She added: “The A.H.A. should not be turned into a vehicle for one group’s Middle East agenda.”

After the vote, James Grossman, the group’s executive director, said he did not think the debate had damaged the group. The discussion “exemplified the way scholars ought to talk about historical issues” he said.

But David Hollinger, a historian at the University of California, Berkeley, said he wished less attention had been paid to “the goodness or badness of Israel” than to defining what he called “the very high threshold” for the association taking a stand on contentious political matters.

One young scholar in support of the resolution, Mr. Hollinger noted, had said he wanted the association to stand up and say what kind of group it was, “progressive or conservative.”

“I’m glad this is an organization that does not define itself by how progressive it is,” Mr. Hollinger said. “The A.H.A. isn’t a progressive organization or a conservative organization. It’s a professional organization.”",https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/09/historian-group-rejects-a-resolution-condemning-israel/

There was a Roomba-like robot that cleans your grill — perfect for that post-labor future in which we’re all too lazy to spend 30 seconds running a brush across the barbecue. In another booth was a robot that roams around a tennis court picking up balls: Ballboys, you’ve just been disrupted.

Despite all the robots, CES was not all bad for humans. In the hall devoted to fitness gadgets were several men and women who’d been employed to walk, run, jump, pedal, lift weights or otherwise work out for extended periods of time, and to smile while doing it. It looked exhausting, but hey, at least it’s a job that no machine can do.

Strangest of all was something spotted by my friend (and podcast co-host) Jay Yarow, the executive editor of Business Insider. At one booth Jay met an entrepreneur who had created an animatronic tail for people to wear. Yes, a tail — long and furry, the appendage straps around your waist and gently sways up and down as you walk.

You may wonder, “Why would anyone want a tail?” To which I’ll counter, “Why would anyone not want a tail?” I’ll note that lots of people asked Bill Gates why anyone would want a P.C., too, and look who’s laughing now.

The oddities at CES show why journalists often complain that the show is a pointless ritual that produces few interesting stories about tech. But it’s also worth noting that to people with real jobs the show takes on a greater importance. A lot of business gets done at CES, often away from the show floor, in the labyrinthine warrens of meeting rooms across the Las Vegas Strip.

The point about business was underscored one morning as I was walking through the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas hotel, where I spotted a door emblazoned with the Twitter logo guarded by a couple of folks wearing blue shirts. I ran into a Twitter public relations representative who offered to take me behind the door, where I found something breathtaking.

In the space of two huge hotel ballrooms, Twitter had created a theme-park-like miniature city, a members-only Twitter town that was realistic enough to be used as a film set. The Potemkin village had shops, restaurants, a sports bar, a theater and an outdoor park with fake grass. It was also quite peaceful; away from the crowds of the show floor, here was a nice park bench overlooking Pleasantville. I spotted Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, in the corner of the town, looking at his phone.

Each “building” in Twitter Town was really a meeting room, the spokesman explained, in which Twitter’s advertising sales teams could show off the service’s potential as a marketing tool to brand advertisers and ad agencies. The whole setup was fantastically detailed: In the sports bar, for example, the TVs would be tuned to show off the brands that Twitter’s salespeople were meeting with.

Twitter wouldn’t tell me how much it spent setting up the town. But the company did say it got a lot done in Twitter Town. Sales people held more than 300 meetings in the span of four days there, the spokesman said. With its fake Paris and fake New York, much of the Las Vegas Strip is a gaudy simulacrum of the rest of the world, and Twitter’s city, like much of CES, was another deeper layer of fakery nested within the larger town. But if real business gets done there — if what happens in Vegas matters in the real world beyond — maybe CES isn’t so useless after all.",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/09/a-tour-of-animatronic-tails-and-a-potemkin-village-at-international-ces/

He worked at Cisco, the American network equipment company, in central Israel and at various start-ups before founding Sadel.

Mr. Sana’s experience is unusual. Many Bedouins have trouble finding such jobs, he said, because they live far from the commercial center of the country, often in villages that the authorities refuse to recognize, without infrastructure; or because recruitment often works through word of mouth and personal contacts that the Bedouins do not have. Then there is basic prejudice, he said, as well as the fact that English is a third language after Arabic and Hebrew for many Arab citizens.

Those problems are particularly acute in the Negev, where tensions have been high in recent years between Bedouins, who number about 200,000, and the Israeli authorities over disputes regarding land ownership. Two years ago, the government shelved a plan to resettle tens of thousands of Bedouin citizens elsewhere in the Negev that had drawn international condemnation and spurred demonstrations across Israel.

In November, Robin Chase, the co-founder and former chief executive of Zipcar, called for a basic income. Venture capitalists like Albert Wenger of Union Square Ventures and John Lilly of Greylock Partners, which invests in LinkedIn and Airbnb, have said that it’s time to starting thinking about a U.B.I. The founder of HowStuffWorks.com, Marshall Brain, even wrote a basic-income novel called “Manna.” It contrasts a nightmare world in which robots are managers and workers slaves with a utopian settlement in the Australian desert in which citizens receive a guaranteed share of the wealth created by such robots and devote themselves to dreaming up innovative new technologies. It’s the Silicon Valley version of heaven.

THIS is all very nice, skeptics say, but the U.B.I. still represents a moral hazard. Give people money for nothing, and the lazy will grow lazier and the rest of us will be bankrupted.

But that does not appear to be the case. On the contrary: The U.B.I. gives workers less reason to loll about at home than do perversely disincentivizing policies like the one whereby a dollar earned is a dollar cut from a welfare check. Research suggests that, rather than weaken the will to work, unconditional regular disbursements let people manage their careers more wisely.

In five famous studies on the negative income tax conducted in the United States and Canada in the 1970s, a minimum income did bring down work hours a bit, partly because the unemployed took longer to find new jobs. Researchers speculate that they were holding out for positions that better matched their skills. In the United States, male breadwinners scaled back by as much as 9 percent a year. In Canada, they hardly cut back at all. In both countries, teenagers stayed in school longer. And women with children did spend up to 30 percent less time on the job.

The U.B.I. has feminist critics as well as supporters, and they don’t like that finding. The U.B.I. would encourage women to drop out of the work force, they say, ceding the ground feminism has fought so hard for. But that concern strikes me as, well, paternalistic. Women should have more choices, not fewer. So should men. Equality between the sexes should not require everyone to conform to traditionally male patterns of employment.

Besides, basic income policies have been shown to mitigate specifically female kinds of poverty.

When cash-transfer experiments were conducted in poor towns in India, girls gained more weight and increased the time they spent at school at greater rates than boys, probably because when cash is scarce, the girls get less to eat and are kept home more.

In the United States, as Kathryn J. Edin and H. Luke Shaefer showed in their book on extreme poverty, “$2.00 a Day,” the process of qualifying for food stamps and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the welfare-to-work program created in 1996, can be so demanding, bewildering and degrading that many applicants simply give up. And who are the patient souls who wait in those daylong lines, pee into cups for drug tests or go home empty-handed? Women, more often than not, since there are more than four times as many families run by single mothers as by single fathers, and a third more households headed by women are on the dole than those run by men.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/opinion/sunday/payback-time-for-women.html

Mr. Penn described their conversation over dinner as casual and warm. He said Mr. Guzmán smiled often.

“I saw him without that smile only in brief flashes,” Mr. Penn wrote. “As has been said of many notorious men, he has an indisputable charisma.”

Mr. Guzmán expressed no interest in politics, Mr. Penn wrote, and doted on Ms. del Castillo throughout the night. He described Mr. Guzmán as “entirely unapologetic” about the impact of the drug trade, and said that he boasted about his success.

Andrew M. Cuomo has spoken frequently about the bridge as a symbol of the state’s ability to once again build major infrastructure, and in his second term he seems increasingly intent on making transportation projects a linchpin of his legacy. He has promised to rebuild La Guardia Airport and supports the construction of a new Hudson River rail tunnel. Just the other day he proposed reviving a long-stalled plan to add a track to part of the Long Island Rail Road’s main line, and announced a plan to redevelop Pennsylvania Station. But the bridge is the only one of those projects actually underway. President Obama, too, has used the rebuilding of the Tappan Zee as a symbol of the administration’s “robust” infrastructure program.

The bridge is expected to cost $3.9 billion. Plans for financing it include federal loans, state funds and construction bonds that would be paid off through tolls. But, with an eye to the costs of daily commuting from Rockland, Mr. Cuomo now proposes to freeze tolls on the Tappan Zee at $5 until 2020, paying for the freeze with a $700 million earmark that would also lock in tolls on the entire Thruway.

Already more than a mile of the blue-steel horizontal framework that will undergird the concrete deck of the new bridge’s southern span stretches boldly from the Rockland County bank across the Hudson, ending abruptly in midriver, and part of a second northern span is already projecting a half-mile from Rockland as well. With a schedule pitched aggressively so the first span of the bridge can open by the spring of 2017 and the full bridge by the following year, many of the workers put in 60 hours a week.

A child of privilege in a house full of computer technology, Swartz makes for a precocious teenage crusader, cultivating friendships with the lawyer and political activist Lawrence Lessig and the World Wide Web inventor, Tim Berners-Lee. Almost immediately, Peters sets up Swartz as a convincing agent of destiny.

Then — and this is unforgivable — Swartz disappears from his own book. For more than a hundred pages, his name is not mentioned once. Instead, Peters gives us an eclectic examination of the evolution of copyright law, a history of the publishing industry and a primer on the Internet. Swartz’s actions require context, of course, but the writer who promises a dispatch from the digital frontier and instead delivers a cribbed history of the Post Office Act of 1792 has surely lost his way.

The moment Peters returns to Swartz — playing a card game on the steps of the Supreme Court as Lessig argues a copyright case inside — the book comes back to life. Just 15, he acts as a sort of mascot for the open-information movement. Dropping out of school, he embarks on a campaign of self-education and, after a year at Stanford, drops out again to start his own company.

His business career is brief. Joining the Reddit team after his project falters, Swartz contributes little but cantankerous comments. Nevertheless he’s an equity partner, and when the company is sold to Condé Nast on Oct. 31, 2006, he receives a substantial windfall. In one of the book’s best passages, Peters describes the lucky kid on Halloween: “He had dressed as a dot-com millionaire, his costume consisting of a steady gaze and an angry expression.”

His colleagues remain in Silicon Valley to pursue their careers; Swartz returns to Boston to diagram the plot of “Infinite Jest.” Preferring the company of progressive activists to venture capitalists, he drafts research papers on congressional corruption and founds a political advocacy organization. Soon he’s taking direct action.

128,The Lawyer Who Became DuPont’s Worst Nightmare,2016-01-10,['Nathaniel Rich'],"3M invented PFOA just four years earlier; it was used to keep coatings like Teflon from clumping during production.
Bilott learned from the documents that 3M and DuPont had been conducting secret medical studies on PFOA for more than four decades.
After 3M shared this information, DuPont tested the children of pregnant employees in their Teflon division.
The same year, DuPont found that water in one local district contained PFOA levels at three times that figure.
(In a statement, DuPont claimed that it did volunteer health information about PFOA to the E.P.A.","['water', '3m', 'bilott', 'internal', 'understatement', 'nightmare', 'information', 'pfoa', 'duponts', 'worst', 'dupont', 'office', 'studies', 'lawyer']","Bilott hunted through his files for other references to PFOA, which he learned was short for perfluorooctanoic acid. But there was nothing. He asked DuPont to share all documentation related to the substance; DuPont refused. In the fall of 2000, Bilott requested a court order to force them. Against DuPont’s protests, the order was granted. Dozens of boxes containing thousands of unorganized documents began to arrive at Taft’s headquarters: private internal correspondence, medical and health reports and confidential studies conducted by DuPont scientists. There were more than 110,000 pages in all, some half a century old. Bilott spent the next few months on the floor of his office, poring over the documents and arranging them in chronological order. He stopped answering his office phone. When people called his secretary, she explained that he was in the office but had not been able to reach the phone in time, because he was trapped on all sides by boxes.

‘‘I started seeing a story,’’ Bilott said. ‘‘I may have been the first one to actually go through them all. It became apparent what was going on: They had known for a long time that this stuff was bad.’’

Bilott is given to understatement. (‘‘To say that Rob Bilott is understated,’’ his colleague Edison Hill says, ‘‘is an understatement.’’) The story that Bilott began to see, cross-legged on his office floor, was astounding in its breadth, specificity and sheer brazenness. ‘‘I was shocked,’’ he said. That was another understatement. Bilott could not believe the scale of incriminating material that DuPont had sent him. The company appeared not to realize what it had handed over. ‘‘It was one of those things where you can’t believe you’re reading what you’re reading,’’ he said. ‘‘That it’s actually been put in writing. It was the kind of stuff you always heard about happening but you never thought you’d see written down.’’

The story began in 1951, when DuPont started purchasing PFOA (which the company refers to as C8) from 3M for use in the manufacturing of Teflon. 3M invented PFOA just four years earlier; it was used to keep coatings like Teflon from clumping during production. Though PFOA was not classified by the government as a hazardous substance, 3M sent DuPont recommendations on how to dispose of it. It was to be incinerated or sent to chemical-waste facilities. DuPont’s own instructions specified that it was not to be flushed into surface water or sewers. But over the decades that followed, DuPont pumped hundreds of thousands of pounds of PFOA powder through the outfall pipes of the Parkersburg facility into the Ohio River. The company dumped 7,100 tons of PFOA-laced sludge into ‘‘digestion ponds’’: open, unlined pits on the Washington Works property, from which the chemical could seep straight into the ground. PFOA entered the local water table, which supplied drinking water to the communities of Parkersburg, Vienna, Little Hocking and Lubeck — more than 100,000 people in all.

Bilott learned from the documents that 3M and DuPont had been conducting secret medical studies on PFOA for more than four decades. In 1961, DuPont researchers found that the chemical could increase the size of the liver in rats and rabbits. A year later, they replicated these results in studies with dogs. PFOA’s peculiar chemical structure made it uncannily resistant to degradation. It also bound to plasma proteins in the blood, circulating through each organ in the body. In the 1970s, DuPont discovered that there were high concentrations of PFOA in the blood of factory workers at Washington Works. They did not tell the E.P.A. at the time. In 1981, 3M — which continued to serve as the supplier of PFOA to DuPont and other corporations — found that ingestion of the substance caused birth defects in rats. After 3M shared this information, DuPont tested the children of pregnant employees in their Teflon division. Of seven births, two had eye defects. DuPont did not make this information public.

In 1984, DuPont became aware that dust vented from factory chimneys settled well beyond the property line and, more disturbing, that PFOA was present in the local water supply. DuPont declined to disclose this finding. In 1991, DuPont scientists determined an internal safety limit for PFOA concentration in drinking water: one part per billion. The same year, DuPont found that water in one local district contained PFOA levels at three times that figure. Despite internal debate, it declined to make the information public.

(In a statement, DuPont claimed that it did volunteer health information about PFOA to the E.P.A. during those decades. When asked for evidence, it forwarded two letters written to West Virginian government agencies from 1982 and 1992, both of which cited internal studies that called into question links between PFOA exposure and human health problems.)",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/magazine/the-lawyer-who-became-duponts-worst-nightmare.html

“Over 50, Female and Jobless Even as Others Return to Work” (front page, Jan. 2) accurately describes the plight facing older women, including highly qualified professionals, in today’s workplace. Not only are older women unable to find new jobs in a marketplace in which age discrimination laws are blatantly violated in hiring and firing, but women are more vulnerable to such treatment, and not merely because they took time off to raise children.

Because of gender discrimination, women are more likely to have been placed on mommy tracks or disadvantaged by a glass ceiling, and have less clout to wield during layoffs or restructurings. Without such power, women become easy targets when, for example, business falls off or a company merges; age discrimination makes it all the more likely that such women will lose their jobs and not find new ones.

Nor are such women accurately represented in the unemployment statistics, since many accept part-time work or, for lack of a better option, become self-employed. Yet the victims of the perfect storm of gender and age discrimination may have financial obligations equal to those of their male counterparts. A lost job can mean a lost home, a disabled child without adequate support or a spouse who is suddenly burdened with the full support of the family.

To remedy such inequities, age discrimination laws must be strengthened and enforced, and gender discrimination acknowledged as a continuing workplace concern. Employers rarely admit, even to themselves, that their choices and actions are discriminatory.

Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the other doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, ‘Do you want to pick door No. 2?’ Is it to your advantage to take the switch?

Ms. vos Savant’s solution wasn’t accepted by everyone, kicking off an astounding amount of correspondence, as described by The Times’ John Tierney in the 1991 article here. This week, thanks to Numberplay regular contributor (and M.I.T.-trained economist), Laura Feiveson, we bring this classic back to life in new form. Let’s try —

Beyond Monty Hall

In the basic Monty Hall problem, the game show host opens a door depending on what the contestant originally picked. With these variations, we have the game show host use a coin to make this decision.

First challenge: Suppose Monty Hall’s game show is losing money, and they want to tweak the game so they don’t lose the car as frequently. They announce to the audience that once you choose the door, the host will flip a fair coin to decide which of the other doors will be opened. If the car is behind the door that they open, you lose. If it is not behind the door that they open, you get to choose whether to stick with your door or to change to the other closed door. What do you do if that happens? And now, going into the game, assuming that the contestant behaves optimally, what is the probability that the game show will lose the car?

Second challenge: Now suppose that the game show gets even greedier, and secretly tweaks the game even more. But news of their tweaking is leaked, and the contestants find out that the host is actually using a weighted coin when they are determining which other door will be opened, and the coin is weighted such that the door with the car behind it will be opened by the host with ¾ probability. (When the car is behind the door that you choose initially, the host uses a fair coin to determine which of the other doors to open.) Now, if the door that they open doesn’t have the car behind it – should you stick with your original choice or should you switch? And, assuming that the contestant behaves optimally, did the nefarious game show succeed in reducing the probability that they lose the car?

Thanks, Laura! That’s it for our challenge this week. As always, once you’re able to read comments for this post, use Gary Hewitt’s Enhancer to correctly view formulas and graphics. (Click here for an intro.) And send your favorite puzzles to gary.antonick@NYTimes.com.

“Some researchers have suggested that gun retailers divert a relatively low volume of weapons, while others have found them to be a major source.”

Image

Some come from gangs and family and friends. Specifically, “Research has put their role as a supply source at 30 to 40 percent of crime guns, but little is known about the composition of this nebulous ‘friends and family’ category.”

And research by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives suggests that “just one percent of licensed firearms dealers sold more than half of the guns recovered in crimes, and that most gun dealers rarely have one of their guns show up in crime.”

But what I found most shocking was the number of guns that are stolen each year: as many as half a million. Each year! And many of those stolen guns are then used in other crimes.

In a 2003 book, “The Challenge of Crime,” published by Harvard University Press, authors quoted researchers who found the following:

“They learned that 32 percent of the felons had acquired their most recent weapon through their own theft; an additional 14 percent knew that their friend, family, or street source had stolen the weapon before conveying it; and an additional 24 percent thought that the weapon probably had been stolen by his source. At least 46 percent, then, and possibly as many as 70 percent of felons’ most recently owned firearms had been stolen either by the offender himself or by the source from whom he acquired the weapon. In addition, 47 percent of the respondents quizzed as to whether they had ever stolen a firearm during a crime admitted to so doing and 86 percent of the felons who admitted prior stealing of firearms reported multiple thefts.”

Rather than focusing on all guns, the vast, vast majority of which are owned by responsible people and are never used in the commission of a crime, we have to focus on keeping guns out of the hands of this relatively small number of criminals.

People, including the president in his speech and town hall meeting last week, like to compare increasing gun regulations to the way cars are regulated. But they didn’t simply get safer due to regulations. They also got safer because the market desired more safety, as well as anti-theft features.

We see her both as a clean-scrubbed, boyish adolescent (being asked by her unseen mother about what she wants out of life) and as the platinum-maned punk god she is today, as she trains a tiny camera on herself.

A monologue — spoken in Italian with English supertitles — finds Ms. Calderoni making lyrical statements about the inadequacy of the vocabulary we have to work with. “I’d like to have a word for ‘the happiness’ that attends disaster,” she says, or for “the hatred of mirrors that begins with middle age.” Or, she adds, “for a girl who’s always been taken for a boy.”

These statements become more than essayistic whenever Ms. Calderoni moves, often to music from the likes of the Smiths, Vampire Weekend, R.E.M. and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Her body is as slender as a grass snake’s, and she sheds clothes — leggings, T-shirts, underpants — as if she were molting. Even stark naked, with a camera taking medical inventory of her body, she seems to belong to no gender.

At one point, as she’s describing her late-arriving puberty, she attaches large clusters of fake hair to her armpits and crotch, which she then uses as pompoms to become a prancing, menacing cheerleader. She wallows on the floor in layers of light that turn her skin blue, a cross between a Smurf and a Playboy centerfold. (Alessio Spirli is the magician responsible for the lighting and the videos.)

There comes a moment in the show when you realize that the first-person narrative Ms. Calderoni is delivering is no longer her own. Readers of Mr. Eugenides’s “Middlesex” will recognize the story now being told in fragments as that of Cal, that novel’s double-gendered protagonist.

Other theatergoers are likely to feel totally at sea. This switch in perspective feels of a piece with Motus’s aim of pulling the comfortable rug out from beneath its audience. And Ms. Calderoni gives vivid life to some of Mr. Eugenides’s most startling set pieces, including a climactic sequence in a freak show.

But I wonder if such literary appropriation was necessary. The production delivers its message most effectively without words. When Ms. Calderoni lies on the floor, raises her pelvis and lets her attenuated body be bisected by a laser of green light, symbol and substance fuse in a way that gives new resonance to gender fluidity, and the androgynous form before us defies division.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/11/theater/review-shedding-skins-in-motuss-genre-blurring-mdlsx-at-la-mama.html
136,"A Personalized Diet, Better Suited to You",2016-01-11,['Kate Murphy'],"Moreover, recent scientific findings are beginning to lend support to a new approach to diet, one personalized to the individual.
“The same dietary advice cannot be good for everyone, because we are all different,” said Eran Elinav, an immunologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel.
“We’re starting to see what links there are between food, microbiota, individual genetic makeup and our health,” Dr. Mathers said.
Companies that provide personalized dietary counseling counter that there is at least enough evidence to improve upon all-purpose dietary recommendations, which have proved largely unsuccessful.
Tellingly, many of the experts who champion the future of personalized nutrition have not been genetically tested themselves, nor have they had their own microbiota analyzed.","['better', 'scientists', 'dr', 'personalized', 'suited', 'sugar', 'nutrition', 'dietary', 'advice', 'mathers', 'genetic', 'foods', 'diet']","Photo

In what has come to feel like a twice-a-decade mea culpa, the federal government last week released another revision of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, this time urging many of us to consume less sugar and less protein. The new recommendations may well influence nutrition labeling, school lunches and government assistance programs.

But the advice is likely to be ignored by much of the I’ll-have-fries-with-that citizenry. Moreover, recent scientific findings are beginning to lend support to a new approach to diet, one personalized to the individual.

Research increasingly suggests that each of us is unique in the way we absorb and metabolize nutrients. This dawning realization has scientists, and entrepreneurs, scrambling to provide more effective nutritional advice based on such distinguishing factors as genetic makeup, gut bacteria, body type and chemical exposures.

“The same dietary advice cannot be good for everyone, because we are all different,” said Eran Elinav, an immunologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. “This is why we have failed so miserably at controlling the obesity epidemic.”

Dr. Elinav and his colleagues are hoping to build a new kind of diet-counseling business from findings they published recently in the journal Cell. Their study found a startling variation in the glucose responses of 800 subjects fed the same foods. Some participants had sharp increases in blood sugar when they ate ice cream and chocolate, while others showed only a flat or moderate response.

Wild variations also occurred when the subjects ate foods like sushi and whole-grain bread, making a mockery of the glycemic index, long used to rank foods according to their effects on blood sugar, and calling into question the reliability of calorie calculations. Each person’s capacity to extract energy from foods differs, it appears.

But the Weizmann team took their findings a step further.

By combining data gleaned from subjects’ glucose responses with information about their gut bacteria, medications, family histories and lifestyles, the scientists devised an algorithm that accurately predicted blood sugar responses to foods the participants hadn’t yet eaten in the study.

Further, with the algorithm the scientists were able to prescribe personalized diets to a group of 100 prediabetic patients that significantly moderated their blood sugar following meals and boosted levels of good bacteria in their guts.

“The algorithm is similar to what Amazon uses to tell you which books you want to read,” said Eran Segal, a computer scientist at the Weizmann Institute and co-author of the study. “We just do it with food.”

Although they have more fine-tuning to do, Dr. Segal said his group hope to eventually use this algorithm to customize dietary advice to the public. Indeed, personalized nutritional counseling is a burgeoning field. Several companies, including Vitagene, Nutrigenomix and DNAFit, are already offering individualized dietary counseling.

Their efforts are based mostly on genetic testing, but scientists have only just begun to explore the links between DNA and good nutrition. “I think companies offering personalized dietary advice are probably running ahead of the evidence,” said John Mathers, director of the Human Nutrition Research Center at Newcastle University in Britain.

More research is needed, he and other experts say, because the interactions among one’s genes, microbiome, diet, environment and lifestyle are so infinitely complex.

Scientists are beginning to tease out the connections. Studies have linked at least 38 genes to nutrient metabolism — variants of which are thought to hinder or help absorption or the efficient use of nutrients in foods. Depending on your genetic makeup, studies suggest you might want to consume more or less folate, choline, vitamin C, fatty acids, starches and caffeine.

“We’re starting to see what links there are between food, microbiota, individual genetic makeup and our health,” Dr. Mathers said. “These different lines of work are beginning to come together now partly because we have the technology to cope with the big data issues.”

Dr. Mathers is the lead investigator of a six-month study, funded by the European Union, called Food4Me. Some 1,500 participants in seven European countries were randomly given personalized dietary advice based on their genetic data, or told to follow standard dietary prescriptions like eating lots of fruits and vegetables, lean meats and whole grains.

While the results haven’t been published yet, Dr. Mathers said, “the bottom line is those who were in the personalized diet cohort did better than those in the one-size-fits-all diet group, making us pretty confident personalized diets are the way forward.”

Still, gene expression, the microbiome and other factors used to personalize diets are not immutable: They may be altered not only by foods, but also by factors like stress and chemical exposures, changing by the year, month or even week.

Companies that provide personalized dietary counseling counter that there is at least enough evidence to improve upon all-purpose dietary recommendations, which have proved largely unsuccessful.

Ahmed El-Sohemy, an associate professor and nutrigenomics researcher at the University of Toronto and a co-founder of Nutrigenomix, offered coffee as an example. Current guidelines advise no more than four or five cups per day.

“That’s fine for roughly half the population that are fast metabolizers,” he said. “For the other half who have a variant of the CYP1A2 gene, any more than two cups per day will increase the risk of a heart attack and hypertension.”

Companies like Nutrigenomix tend to offer mostly nutritional advice, rather than diets to treat specific diseases, and therefore the Food and Drug Administration does not regulate this new and potentially lucrative business. (Enforcement would be tough anyway, as many providers are based in other countries.)

So buyers beware. Discuss any prescribed dietary changes with a doctor or registered dietitian.

Tellingly, many of the experts who champion the future of personalized nutrition have not been genetically tested themselves, nor have they had their own microbiota analyzed.

“I like to enjoy my food,” Dr. Mathers said. “That’s where I start.”

The article was edited by Mr. Wenner and Mr. Fine, with Mr. Fine responsible for the final line editing before publication.
Mr. Fine said that he, too, had considered the ethics involved with the article’s publication and the magazine’s arrangement with its subject.
If Mr. Guzmán wanted changes, he said, the magazine had the option of not publishing the piece.
Osama bin Laden was interviewed through the late 1990s, after he had declared jihad on the United States (though before the Sept. 11 attacks).","['united', 'mr', 'stone', 'rolling', 'handled', 'el', 'chapo', 'ramifications', 'wenner', 'penn', 'guzmán', 'style', 'authorities', 'article', 'states', 'exclusive', 'fine']","The reporting and editing of the article were closely held, in part, to avoid the authorities. “I was worried that I did not want to provide the details that would be responsible for his capture,” Mr. Wenner said. “We were very conscientious on our end and on Sean’s end, keeping it quiet, using a separate protected part of our server for emails.”

Around Thanksgiving, as Mr. Penn negotiated with Mr. Guzmán and his intermediaries to include a video component of the interview, which was eventually sent to him by courier, the magazine was convinced that it would have to resist pressure from the authorities in the United States and Mexico who would want to learn as much as they could about Mr. Guzmán’s whereabouts.

“We made sure we didn’t have any information to give them, other than what we published,” he said. “But we would have done everything that a traditional journalism operation would have done in terms of protecting sources.”

Mr. Wenner said that Mr. Guzmán seemed to have become careless with those he contacted while on the run, and would most likely have been tracked whether or not Mr. Penn wrote an article. In fact, the meeting between Mr. Guzmán and Mr. Penn had been monitored by the authorities, according to a Mexican official with knowledge of the operation. That led to an October raid on Mr. Guzmán’s compound in the state of Durango in which he managed to evade capture but which gave the authorities more intelligence about his movements.

The article was edited by Mr. Wenner and Mr. Fine, with Mr. Fine responsible for the final line editing before publication. Responding to criticisms of the piece’s distinctive writing style, which was mocked on social media, and its discursions into topics including flatulence and technology, Mr. Fine said: “It’s a piece by Sean Penn. Sean Penn has a particular style and point of view, and I’m happy with it.”

Mr. Penn has not commented publicly since the article was published.

Mr. Fine said that he, too, had considered the ethics involved with the article’s publication and the magazine’s arrangement with its subject. If Mr. Guzmán wanted changes, he said, the magazine had the option of not publishing the piece.

There is a long history of journalists interviewing subjects who were either on the run from the authorities or who were considered unsavory for other reasons. Osama bin Laden was interviewed through the late 1990s, after he had declared jihad on the United States (though before the Sept. 11 attacks).

The approach to be used takes advantage of the fact that DNA from cancerous cells can be found in the blood, albeit in minute amounts. The blood test, using intensive DNA sequencing, would look for patterns of telltale mutations.

Many companies are developing similar tests, known as liquid biopsies, that use a blood sample to replace or supplement a conventional biopsy, in which a sample of the tumor is extracted from the body by needle or surgery. In just the last week, one company, Guardant Health, said it had raised nearly $100 million in its latest funding round while another, Exosome Diagnostics, said it had raised $60 million.

But so far, liquid biopsies are mainly used for patients already known to have cancer. The tests help determine the particular mutations in the tumor to help select the best drugs to use. Or they are used to monitor whether treatment is effective or to check for a recurrence.

Nonetheless, Mr. Stringer and Mr. Jeffries could represent starkly different threats to Mr. de Blasio.

Mr. Stringer, 55, is a down-the-line liberal from a political family, an ambitious but deliberative politician who climbed steadily from a State Assembly seat on Manhattan’s Upper West Side into the offices of Manhattan borough president and then comptroller.

In contrast, Mr. Jeffries, 45, has made his way as a young man in a hurry. He first challenged an incumbent state assemblyman and then a sitting congressman in a predominantly black district in central Brooklyn, drawing support from unconventional precincts — including charter-school donors and conservative pro-Israel activists — on his way to Washington.

Yet the Democrats’ careers have intersected at pivotal moments. When Mr. Jeffries faced an incendiary primary opponent in his 2012 congressional race, Mr. Stringer and his wife hosted a fund-raising event for Mr. Jeffries in their apartment. A year later, Mr. Jeffries campaigned hard for Mr. Stringer in his bid for comptroller, appearing with him at churches and subway stations in an uphill primary fight against Eliot Spitzer, the former governor.

These days, they share a common orientation toward Mr. de Blasio. Mr. Jeffries and Mr. Stringer have both prodded him on matters of policy: Mr. Stringer issuing audits from his perch as comptroller, Mr. Jeffries employing the megaphone that federal office provides. Both have chided Mr. de Blasio, on occasion, for his perceived fixation on national politics.

Mr. Jeffries and Mr. Stringer also enjoy warmer relations with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who clashes often with the mayor. The governor hosted a fund-raising event for Mr. Jeffries’s congressional campaign in November, praising the congressman, according to attendees, as a Democrat who knows how to get things done.

Google, facing increased scrutiny from European regulators, has hired a former senior adviser to President Obama to lead its global public policy team.

Caroline Atkinson, who left her position as a White House deputy national security adviser last month, will join Google in March and be based in Washington.

Her most pressing task will be to temper concerns by antitrust enforcement officials in the European Union, which has accused the company of abusing its dominance in web search.

Ms. Atkinson, who joined the administration in 2011, is the latest in a string of Obama administration officials to join Silicon Valley companies. David Plouffe, also a former adviser, joined Uber in August 2014, and Jay Carney, a former press secretary, was hired by Amazon early last year.

As Silicon Valley companies have grown in influence, they’ve raised greater regulatory concerns over competition and privacy. The senior government officials have been hired to help navigate the regulatory landscape and coordinate campaigns aimed at softening the images of their companies.

Ms. Atkinson served as Mr. Obama’s representative at gatherings of the Group of 8 and Group of 20 and at other major economic summit meetings. A former official at the International Monetary Fund, Ms. Atkinson began her career as a journalist. She replaces Rachel Whetstone, Google’s longtime head of policy, who left for Uber in May.

The promoters behind Coachella are bringing a new pop festival to New York in July, after months of behind-the-scenes lobbying and a press-release war with a homegrown competitor, Governors Ball.

The new festival, called Panorama, will come to Randalls Island from July 22 to 24, bringing “three days of top-tier musical performances, dynamic art installations, innovative technology and some of N.Y.C.’s best local eats,” according to an announcement from Goldenvoice, the promoter, on Monday. No details about the performers or ticket information were announced.

“We’re committed to creating an event that will provide significant benefits to New York City with the level of experience and meticulous attention to detail for which Goldenvoice is known,” Mark Shulman, a festival promoter at Goldenvoice, which also presents Coachella in Indio, Calif., each April, said in a statement.

The arrival of a New York complement to Coachella has been expected at least since September, when news emerged of expansion plans by A.E.G. Live, the giant concert promoter and venue operator that owns Goldenvoice. Those plans were immediately opposed by Founders Entertainment, the small company behind Governors Ball, which complained of an “aggressive, greedy attempt” by a corporate power to compete with a local independent group, and garnered more than 8,000 signatures for an online petition asking the city to block the new event.

A.E.G. reportedly retained high-powered lobbyists to push for permits, but the company apparently abandoned its original plans to mount the festival in Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens. Instead, Goldenvoice has booked Randalls Island, where Governors Ball has also been staged since 2012. This June, Governors Ball will return there with Kanye West, the Strokes, Beck and the Killers.

Tom Russell, one of the three young promoters behind Founders and Governors Ball, criticized the arrival of Panorama on Tuesday as “a short-sighted and disappointing solution.”

“The city needs a long-term strategy for approving music festivals that ensures it is maximizing the economic and community impact of these events,” Mr. Russell said.

Coachella has been hailed as one of the major forces behind the growth of pop festivals in the United States in recent years, and Goldenvoice has amassed a rare power over the booking of top acts and even the timing of the lineup announcements by competing festivals. Last year’s edition sold $84 million in tickets, far more than any other festival, according to the trade publication Pollstar. And for its edition this year, Coachella will present the reunions of Guns N’ Roses and LCD Soundsystem.

A.E.G. Live, the second-largest concert promoter in the world after Live Nation, also worked with Goldenvoice to present the All Points West festival in Jersey City, which was hailed at the time as another East Coast Coachella but lasted only two years, 2008 and 2009.",https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/coachella-panorama-festival-new-york/

Dryer, who directs NASA’s Advanced Air Vehicles Program.

To achieve the drastic emissions reductions that may be required by the middle of the century and beyond — to make aviation as carbon-free as possible — new “clean sheet” aircraft designs may be needed, incorporating new technologies and approaches. That’s where the Armstrong Flight Research Center comes in, developing technological concepts that manufacturers may one day use in radical new designs.

Not far from the LeapTech truck is another hangar containing a Gulfstream business jet that has been stripped bare and wired with hundreds of sensors. It is a flying technology test bed, and is testing modifications to the trailing edge of the wings. Where a flap would normally be, there is instead a continuous, bent surface, which changes the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing.

The concept is still being developed, but the eventual goal would be wings that could morph in response to real-time conditions. “The idea is to ultimately replace the entire trailing edge of an aircraft wing with technology like this, so you could continuously change the shape of the wing to reduce drag and increase lift,” said Ethan Baumann, chief engineer for the test jet. The technology could also allow the drag and lift forces to be shifted around the wings to avoid overloading, so the wings could be lighter than conventional ones.

Arguably, the world is changing faster than at any point in history — in global warming, migration, technology, terrorism, national borders and genetics. The overriding challenge for the next president will be to coolly assess, prioritize and act on these daunting threats and opportunities.

Our first instinct is to recoil from change, taking refuge in a simpler, more prosperous time, 1950s Middle America, for example.

Their genius lay precisely in knowing that future crises could not be imagined in their time, leaving us the flexibility to respond to change and avoiding the pitfalls of rigid prescriptions.

Overreaction to change can also sap our strength. American exceptionalism, once shorthand for our can-do spirit and self-confidence, has been stood on its head as a bulwark against change on immigration, taxes and health.

Silicon Valley wealth can end up in unexpected places, with unusual results.

One such example would be the wealth created by the social network Facebook, which over the years has reaped a bonanza for its co-founders, investors, early employees and others. Much of that money has gone into the usual gamut of things on the Silicon Valley spending list: new start-ups, some philanthropic efforts, not to mention cars, houses and high-priced vacations.

But one atypical use of the Facebook money was the acquisition made in 2012 by Chris Hughes, one of the social network’s co-founders, who used part of his fortune to purchase The New Republic, a magazine known for its intellectual pieces, left-leaning political views and the nurturing of promising writers and editors.

Uber, the huge ride-hailing service, delivers millions of rides to passengers. Now the company wants to give people something to do while they’re in the car.

On Tuesday, Uber introduced a way for smartphone app developers to create “trip experiences” for riders. The idea, the company says, is to give riders tailored information and entertainment during their time in an Uber vehicle.

Uber gave a few examples of how it might look. Upon entering the vehicle, riders could receive a quick news briefing or perhaps be served with a music playlist built to last the length of their ride.

“What if developers could also offer users of their apps new ways to enjoy themselves — or get stuff done — while they’re on the road?” Chris Saad, head of product on Uber’s developer platform, wrote in a company blog post. “These integrations help make life simpler and easier for people to get around.”

Uber has long been selective about how it works with partner apps and companies. It has struck deals with Facebook, Foursquare and OpenTable to allow users to hail rides from inside the companies’ apps. Uber is also working with a handful of retailers in some cities for its delivery service, UberRush.

For Uber, the goal is to make the user experience more pleasant than a usual ride, which may in turn drum up repeat business and affinity for the company’s brand. The company has struck similar partnerships in the past, such as one with Spotify, in which users can select the songs being played during their Uber rides.

This approach invites developers to work directly with Uber to submit and test their ideas, but Uber will have final say over whether a developer’s trip experience will be allowed. It is a different, more cautious approach than that taken by companies like Facebook and Twitter, both of which have had strained relationships with third-party developers in the past.

The announcement coincided with Uber’s first hackathon in Bangalore, India, where the company is soliciting developers for new integration ideas. The company expects that the first trip experiences will not appear for at least a few weeks, depending on how quickly developers submit, test and release their ideas.",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/uber-invites-developers-to-build-apps-for-customized-passenger-distractions/

But in the meantime, as many as 100 million Brazilians had been seriously inconvenienced, and civil libertarians around the world looked on with dismay.

Brazilians take their social media very seriously. The country has one of the fastest growing populations of Internet users in the world. Online tools like Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp are used not only to express opinions; they are an affordable alternative to exorbitantly priced Brazilian telecom providers. One recent study in Brazil found that WhatsApp was used by 93 percent of those surveyed who had Internet access.

The official reason for the judge’s decision to suspend WhatsApp was because its parent company, Facebook, refused to comply with requests to provide personal information and communications records to prosecutors in an investigation into organized crime and drug trafficking. This is not the first time that the Brazilian authorities have jousted with tech companies. Notwithstanding the seriousness of the crimes being investigated, the judge’s action was reckless and represents a potentially longer-term threat to the freedoms of Brazilians.

The ruling was not entirely out of the blue. Brazil’s Congress has been considering legislation that would roll back key provisions of the country’s freshly minted digital bill of rights, known as the Marco Civil da Internet, which was passed in 2014.

On jobs and the economy, the president pointed to a 5 percent unemployment rate and sustained growth. But Congress has blocked many job-creation initiatives, including more spending on energy and infrastructure. Still, the administration’s failure to provide meaningful mortgage relief in the financial crisis meant that many homeowners never got the help they needed.

Tretter, a Cornell University graduate, barely slowed Washington’s Preston Smith when he recorded a safety on Green Bay’s second possession. As the visitors fell behind 11-0, the Green Bay line opened no holes and allowed Aaron Rodgers little time — it was the worst of lines. In the second half, Rodgers had sufficient time as the line allowed no sacks. After intermission, Tretter was near-flawless — go Big Red! On the game’s pivotal drive, Packers tailbacks had nice holes for gains of 11 yards, 30 yards and 4 yards for the touchdown that made the score 24-18 Green Bay.

In the first half, Washington had the best of lines as the hosts took an 11-0 lead with Kirk Cousins comfortable in the pocket. Then Washington’s blockers became the worst of lines, allowing five sacks from the juncture of the 11-0 lead and six over all, versus 1.7 sacks per game allowed during the regular season. All but one sack came against a standard four-man rush, when Washington had more blockers than there were pass rushers; and on a fourth-quarter third-and-19, Cousins was forced to throw the ball away when six blockers could not handle four rushers.

Zappos, the online shoe retailer experimenting with the radical self-management system Holacracy, is continuing to hemorrhage employees.

In a post on the company’s website, Arun Rajan, the chief operating officer, said 18 percent of the company, or some 260 people, had left the company since March.

The exodus began after the chief executive, Tony Hsieh, announced that the company was going to adopt Holacracy, which is supposed to promote collaboration and abolish hierarchy. Anyone who did not accept the change could take a generous buyout, Mr. Hsieh said at the time. Within weeks, about 14 percent of the company, or 210 employees, had left the company, an Amazon subsidiary known for its playful corporate culture, convivial atmosphere and ample perks.

When The Times visited Zappos headquarters in Las Vegas last summer, employees were just getting familiar with Holacracy. Some said they were excited about contributing to new areas of the company and many welcomed the opportunity for more autonomy.

But even then, many employees were confused. Who did they report to if there were no bosses? What was expected of them if they did not have a job title? How would they be compensated? At the time, even company loyalists admitted growing pains:

“There’s no putting rose-colored glasses on it,” said John Bunch, who is leading the Holacracy push throughout Zappos. “We’re just taking baby steps.”

“It is really painful and slow at first,” said Christa Foley, a 10-year Zappos veteran.

Even Josh Pedro, who is in charge of managing Zappos’s public relations, did not sugarcoat the situation. “It was a weird transition,” he confessed.



Apparently not much has changed.

The latest departures came from a group of employees who were helping Zappos migrate to Super Cloud, a back-end infrastructure run by Amazon. The arduous, yearslong effort to move Zappos to Amazon’s servers has effectively frozen the company’s website, and employees working on the project were offered more time before taking the buyout.

Mr. Rajan said that the migration to Super Cloud, which he had hoped to complete last year, was still ongoing. Meanwhile, 38 percent of those working on the Super Cloud transition took the buyout offer.

“While we have lost a number of folks, it is important to note that we have a significant group of highly talented individuals who will be staying to help move Zappos forward,” Mr. Rajan wrote.

Zappos isn’t at risk of closing shop. But the latest departures represent another blow to Holacracy and to Mr. Hsieh’s vision of a harmonious, self-organizing company. Zappos declined to comment.",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/13/after-a-radical-management-experiment-the-zappos-exodus-continues/

Maps tell stories about natural and human geography and geopolitics, whether by displaying the shapes of landforms and locations of cities or by highlighting global fashion trends or the routes of explorers.

But many students get overwhelmed by their own unfamiliarity with geography or by what might seem like an overload of information. Just like any other kind of visual thinking, learning to read maps accurately and with confidence takes practice.

In this lesson, we provide strategies to help students gain that confidence so they can interpret even the most complex historical or current maps. We also suggest ways for using current events maps as a tool to better understand both history and what’s going on in the world today.

How do you use maps in your classroom? Let us know in the comments.

Analyzing Maps

Learning how to analyze maps is a skill that requires practice. Below, we propose an extended process that can be used over several days, weeks or even a school year — and that borrows from the approach we outlined for analyzing political cartoons. The strength of this process is that it does not force students to immediately come up with right answers, but instead emphasizes visual thinking and close reading skills. It provides a way for all students to participate, while at the same time building up students’ academic vocabulary so they can develop more sophisticated analyses over time.

Open-Ended Questioning

We suggest beginning map analysis using the same three-question protocol we utilize every Monday for our “What’s Going On in This Picture?” feature to help students bring to the surface what the map is saying:

What is going on in this map?

What do you see that makes you say that?

What more can you find?

These simple, open-ended questions push students to look closely at the map without pressuring them to come up with a “correct” interpretation. Students can notice details and make observations without rushing, while the cyclical nature of the questions keeps sending them back to look for more details.

The Library of Congress suggests a similar open-ended approach to reading maps in this teacher’s guide (PDF), but adds one very important element to the analysis: Think about the source.

Observe: Ask students to identify and note details.

Reflect: Encourage students to generate and test hypotheses about the source.

Question: Invite students to ask questions that lead to more observations and reflections.

Reflecting on who is the source is an important habit for students to adopt for whenever they are working with documents, and with enough practice it should become just one more thing students look for when analyzing maps.

Developing Map Vocabulary and a Keener Eye

Once students gain confidence noticing details and suggesting interpretations, always backed up by evidence, it is useful to introduce them to specific map elements, such as key, scale, longitude and latitude lines, compass rose and contour lines, that cartographers frequently use. Over time they should also become familiar with common map types, such as topographic and political maps, and even some map projections.

Helping students recognize and identify these cartographers’ tools will enable them to make more sophisticated analyses.

The National Archives provides this map analysis worksheet (also available as a PDF), which asks students to identify a map’s type and any unique physical qualities.

When students get comfortable using the relevant academic vocabulary to describe what’s going on in a map, we suggest returning to the open-ended analysis questions we started with, so students can become more independent and confident map readers.

How to Use Current Events Maps to Better Understand Both History and the World Today

Maps representing historical events, such as the spread of the Black Death during the Middle Ages or the rise of Latin-American independence movements, are commonly taught documents in history classes. But for many history and social studies teachers, maps detailing current events aren’t as obvious a classroom resource.

Here are some suggestions for how to turn global current events maps published in The New York Times and elsewhere into teaching tools. (In 2014, we published a similar lesson about teaching with United States maps, “Baseball, Happiness and Immigration: Exploring American Society and History With New York Times Maps.”)

Comparing History With Current Events

Photo

One way to incorporate a global current events map into a lesson is to tie it to the history you’re already studying.

For example, for classes studying the Silk Road, it would be interesting to compare this map illustrating China’s global trade with a map of Silk Road trade routes (PDF).

After looking closely at each map using the questioning protocol described above, students can consider:

What does each map show about China’s trading partners?

What similarities or differences do you notice?

Or, students can compare the current global refugee crisis using this world map or these regional maps with previous refugee crises, such as the one after World War II or the one resulting from the partition of India and Pakistan.

Photo

Another idea is to use these maps showing Russia’s recent military buildup to make comparisons with military tensions during the Cold War.

And, students could look at a map displaying the distribution of Shiite and Sunni Muslims in the Middle East, and then compare sectarian tensions within the Muslim world today with other historical examples of sectarian and religious conflict.

What other ideas can you come up with to compare historical and current events? Please share them in the comments section.

Using Current Events Maps to Teach … Current Events

Many teachers set aside time in their curriculum to cover current events — perhaps as a “Currents Events Friday” routine or whenever major news breaks. Teachers typically might select an article, or assign students to find their own articles, to read, analyze and discuss.

But as an alternative, or a complement, to reading news articles, teachers can ask students to analyze visual images about current events, such as photographs, graphs and maps.

Below is a selection of additional maps The Times published in the past year that can help bring the important news of the day alive for students — and help them practice their map-reading skills at the same time:

Syrian Civil War

Climate Change

ISIS and Terrorism

China

Afghanistan

Going Further: Students Make Their Own Maps

Photo

One way to get students more comfortable and proficient at reading maps is to give them the opportunity to design their own. With so many free online mapmaking tools, students can make their own maps illustrating data on almost anything they can imagine.

National Geographic’s MapMaker Interactive is one such tool that lets students add layers to a variety of base maps. For example, they can layer volcanic eruptions on a topographic map (as in the above example), or lights at night on a satellite map. Students can display their finished maps in a gallery with written captions that explain the information their maps illustrate.

And since maps are one of the best-known kinds of infographics, you might look through this post, Data Visualized: More on Teaching With Infographics, for additional ideas.

But they may have also been confusing for consumers who would like a one-word association with the notion of Oregon pinot noir.

The 2008s were ripe and powerful. The ’09s were lush and soft, while 2010 was fresh and high-toned. I loved the 2011 vintage. The growing season was long and cool, resulting in wines of great finesse and clarity that ought to age well. Many people have pronounced 2012 a landmark vintage. That may well have been true from the grower’s perspective. It was warmer and drier than 2011, without any of the anxiety over whether the grapes would ripen before the fall rains began. The wines were opulent and fleshy with plenty of soft, dark fruit. They were a perfect counterpoint to the 2011s.

Which brings us to 2013, a year that took a different turn. The vintage seemed set up to be good. Growers likened it to 2012, but instead of the dry, warm September and October that capped that year (and saved the year before), rains began in September and growers either had to pick the grapes early, perhaps sooner than they would have preferred, or risk rot and damage in the hopes of a dry spell. Either way, growers lost a good deal of their yield and the vintage was small.

A wine panel tasting of 20 bottles of 2013 pinot noir affirmed the departure from previous vintages. In the context of Oregon, where more and more small producers have started making wine in the last decade, 20 is far from a complete tasting, but it was a good cross section and offered an accurate sense of the character of the vintage.

Netflix is taking steps to dominate the world of digital streaming globally. Which other tech company does it most take after?

For technology columnist Farhad Manjoo, the answer is Amazon. “What if Netflix is the Amazon of the entertainment industry — the embodiment of a slow, expensive, high-risk effort to consume the entirety of your business?” Mr. Manjoo writes in the State of the Art column, posing that question to media moguls.

Zappos, the online shoe retailer experimenting with the radical self-management system Holacracy, is continuing to hemorrhage employees.

In a post on the company’s website, Arun Rajan, the chief operating officer, said 18 percent of the company, or some 260 people, had left the company since March.

The exodus began after the chief executive, Tony Hsieh, announced that the company was going to adopt Holacracy, which is supposed to promote collaboration and abolish hierarchy. Anyone who did not accept the change could take a generous buyout, Mr. Hsieh said at the time. Within weeks, about 14 percent of the company, or 210 employees, had left the company, an Amazon subsidiary known for its playful corporate culture, convivial atmosphere and ample perks.

When The Times visited Zappos headquarters in Las Vegas last summer, employees were just getting familiar with Holacracy. Some said they were excited about contributing to new areas of the company and many welcomed the opportunity for more autonomy.

But even then, many employees were confused. Who did they report to if there were no bosses? What was expected of them if they did not have a job title? How would they be compensated? At the time, even company loyalists admitted growing pains:

“There’s no putting rose-colored glasses on it,” said John Bunch, who is leading the Holacracy push throughout Zappos. “We’re just taking baby steps.”

“It is really painful and slow at first,” said Christa Foley, a 10-year Zappos veteran.

Even Josh Pedro, who is in charge of managing Zappos’s public relations, did not sugarcoat the situation. “It was a weird transition,” he confessed.



Apparently not much has changed.

The latest departures came from a group of employees who were helping Zappos migrate to Super Cloud, a back-end infrastructure run by Amazon. The arduous, yearslong effort to move Zappos to Amazon’s servers has effectively frozen the company’s website, and employees working on the project were offered more time before taking the buyout.

Mr. Rajan said that the migration to Super Cloud, which he had hoped to complete last year, was still ongoing. Meanwhile, 38 percent of those working on the Super Cloud transition took the buyout offer.

“While we have lost a number of folks, it is important to note that we have a significant group of highly talented individuals who will be staying to help move Zappos forward,” Mr. Rajan wrote.

Zappos isn’t at risk of closing shop. But the latest departures represent another blow to Holacracy and to Mr. Hsieh’s vision of a harmonious, self-organizing company.

A. All-in-one security suites (which typically sell for $30 and more) promise all-around protection and have their advantages.

On a recent morning, my run took me past our local bagel shop, just early enough that the blooming scent of carby goodness wafted out the front door and chased me down the street.

When I got home, I dished out my usual breakfast of plain, full-fat yogurt, topped with fruit (a pear that day) and maple syrup, then typed out the following tweet: “Also pro tip: don’t run past the bagel shop if you don’t plan on stopping for a bagel.”

My friend Hillary replied: “My husband is roasting an everything bagel right now. It’s torture, the one thing I miss when skipping simple carbs.”

Such is a benefit of living alone — at least for me. Because I cook for one, I can make whatever I want and not let the scent of a toasting bagel lure me away from what I need to eat to reach my health goals, which right now are to stay lean while training for my sixth marathon, which I’ll run in May.

Food and singledom is the subject of two recent studies that come down on either side of whether or not bachelorhood does a body good. One found that single people lean toward being skinnier than those who cohabitate. The other found that living with someone means you tend to eat healthier than if you live alone.

The first report, published recently in the Journal of Family Issues, looked at 20 years of data from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, a long-running federal study of Americans who were 14 to 22 when they were first interviewed in 1979. It found that in general, living alone was associated with lower body mass index compared to living with someone else.

The study’s author, Jay D. Teachman, a professor of sociology at Western Washington University, conjectures that married people get into routines, but also that the nonpartnered may have more of an incentive to stay fit and trim because they are in the dating market. Plus, without someone else there to judge, singles “might be more likely to just open the refrigerator and grab a yogurt and call it good,” he said.

In the other study, published in August in Nutrition Reviews, researchers from the Queensland University of Technology looked at 41 English-language studies that examined the relationship between food intake and living alone. They found that, in general, people who live alone have lower diversity in what they eat and that they eat fewer fruits and vegetables and less fish than people who are partnered.

Katherine L. Hanna, the lead researcher on the study and a lecturer at the School of Exercise and Nutrition studies at the university, noted that there were “inconsistencies” between individual studies, and that the group’s findings are a starting point for future research. But she speculates that economic factors may be one reason that single people tend to eat less nutritious food.

Ultimately, “it really depends on the individual person,” said Katherine W. Bauer, an assistant professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, who was not involved in either study. “How much importance do they place on healthy eating, regardless of living status?”

I’ve been on both sides of the “living status” line. When I lived with a boyfriend, some of my food choices revolved around compromise: What did I want to eat that would appease him too? After we split and I nearly broke my foot in a marathon, I fell into bad eating habits, sometimes consuming dinners of blue corn nachos doused in cheese, then dipped into salsa and hummus and washed down with two glasses of wine. Why bother making a fancy dinner when it was just me and the dog, who did her part by licking my plate clean when I was through?

But last spring, when I set out to lose some weight, I did so without someone else watching over my shoulder or asking that I make things that I didn’t want to eat. I felt no pressure to add a side of pasta to my salad, or rice to the bottom of my bean dish, because no one else was there to care. I gave up alcohol for August, too. And while that knocked out some of my typical dating opportunities (going to grab a drink was out, though this knocked out candidates who refused to hang out with me without the aid of alcohol — not really a bad thing), I didn’t need to keep booze in my house because another person wanted it, and therefore I wasn’t tempted by it.

I could also experiment with dishes without another person being affected by a recipe failure. And if I did fail, I sometimes did what Dr. Teachman described: I’d just grab some yogurt and call it a night.

The result: I lost 25 pounds from my peak weight, and now I eat better and drink a lot less alcohol. I’ve kept the weight off too.

But part of that, I know, is me: I like cooking, and I have an incentive — faster race times — to keep the weight off. I also have easy access to fresh foods, know how to make them taste good and, because I work from home, don’t have a long commute that makes coming home to cook dinner feel like one weight stacked onto the other.

“A lot of it is driven by who the person is,” Dr. Bauer said. “It depends on where you’re starting from.” Or, as is the case for me, where I’m going: a faster finish line.

A. The first part of the scene was shot in the Bow River, two hours from Calgary. We found this cave that was a natural formation. It was perfect because it allowed us to have Hugh hidden there. But at the same time, he was exposed enough to be found by the Arikaras. It facilitated a way to have him drag himself into the water in one movement.

When we go into the action scene of the river swallowing him, we had to do that in the north of Montana. We had to find a river that would allow us to be safe in the production, but at the same time show the danger. It took a huge amount of time location scouting to find a river that would match geographically and at the same time allow us technically to do the job.

Your cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, went into the water to shoot this?

Yes. He went in with the camera and to do these choreographed movements. Every movement was designed months in advance. The second part of the river sequence, in Montana, was shot 11 months after the first. It took us almost a year for us to understand how we were going to do it technically.

Did you scout a number of rivers?

We looked at many rivers in the United States that didn’t work for different reasons. Some were too narrow, or too wide, or too dangerous. Some they wouldn’t allow us to shoot or it was too cold. Or the nature didn’t match what we shot before, or the direction of the light was wrong. It was crazy. Then we had to figure out how to combine shooting the scene with Leo and with stuntmen, making it look scary. There’s no C.G.I. water here. To shoot a river like this is extremely challenging.

What other ways did you find the scene a challenge?

Because we’re shooting with long lenses, we’re not hiding a lot of things. We are seeing everything all the time, so everything has to be 360 degrees usable.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/14/movies/alejandro-g-inarritu-narrates-a-scene-from-the-revenant.html

For the undeterred, applications are due Friday.

The eight-page application for the open seat of Chicago police superintendent makes clear the challenges that will face the next leader of the 12,000- sworn officer force, who will inherit a department facing a federal investigation into its practices, an impassioned protest movement, a recent leap in an already high homicide rate and the political turmoil surrounding Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

Amie Tsang reports in DealBook. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index in the United States dropped 2.5 percent on Wednesday, despite two days of gains that suggested confidence might be returning after a tumultuous start to the year, Peter Eavis reports in DealBook. The technology-heavy Nasdaq dropped 3.4 percent. Markets in Asia had followed by opening lower, but Chinese stocks rebounded late in the day to finish higher.

ANHEUSER-BUSCH INBEV SETS $46 BILLION BOND SALE | Anheuser-Busch InBev completed a $46 billion, seven-part bond deal to finance its acquisition of SABMiller, in the second-largest corporate debt offering ever in the United States,

Liz Moyer reports in DealBook. Investors put in orders for $117 billion, rushing for a piece of the investment grade deal as global stock markets have continued to be turbulent through the new year. Brendan Hanley, the co-head of investment-grade capital markets in the Americas at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said the bond offering was attractive because it had a strong credit profile and it involved global brands with a “strong track record with bondholders.” Last year’s merger boom set up a string of big bond transactions for this year as companies try to finance their purchases. Anheuser-Busch InBev had agreed to buy SABMiller in November for $106 billion.

I could have. I am lucky. I could have taken off work, I could have cut days in half I could have spent more time with him. It was my mistake and a mistake I blame myself for every day. But there are many people in this state who do not have the choice. A parent is dying, a child is sick, they can’t take off of work.

“Their employer says, if you don’t come you are fire, if you don’t come you don’t get paid. People have children and mothers run the risk of losing their job if they stay home with their child. Out of 185 countries, the United States is one of just three that does not have paid maternity leave. The others are Suriname and Papua New Guinea. This is not where New York should be. We should have a paid leave program, paid for by employees, who can get twelve weeks of pay and Senator Jeff Klein is exactly right.

“At the end of the day family matters. Intimate relationships matter and in this 24/7 world let this state make a statement of what is really important and those relationships are important. We should be there, one for another, especially in a family environment. Let’s pass family leave this session.

“The second issue, last March, Sandy mentioned to me she was going for a breast exam. I didn’t think anything of it, Sandy was — had no family history of cancer, 48 years old so it was just a regular check up. A few days later she called me up, she was crying. What happened? She got the results from the screening and one word changed our life: cancer.

“And that started weeks and weeks and days of a torturous long road with tears and pain that I cannot even begin to articulate. Sandy was great. You know how they say you can really tell a person’s mettle in tough times and when the heat is on. She got stronger, she got braver, she didn’t complain, she had a double mastectomy. Went through that, was recovering at home and all she was thinking about is how do I take this experience and use the energy to help others. How do I take the negative and how do I make it a positive? I just want her to know she was such an inspiration to me because that strength and that love for community is everything we talk about. But you did it.

“Now since Sandy’s operation, she has talked about it, word got out about it. Since her operation three women who work with me in their thirties and forties came to me and said, I heard what happened with Sandy, I went and got a screenings. Three women all three had breast cancer. And they never would have gone but if not for Sandy. I know ask women who are in the target age group, ‘Do you go for screenings?’ They say, ‘Well it’s hard, I can’t, my insurance, my kids, work, family.’

Chris Christie of New Jersey started running away from his own record on sensible gun controls as soon as he began his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. Shameless pandering to voters in gun-friendly states has ensued. Mr. Christie abandoned his onetime fierce support of an assault weapons ban and reversed his opposition to armor-piercing .50-caliber rifles that have no place in civilized society.

Mr. Christie could still show some backbone by signing a measure the state Legislature passed this week, requiring retailers to stock “smart” handguns that are equipped with technologies that allow only the owners to fire the weapons. As the technology advances, this approach could ease conflict on the gun issue between the two political parties; it would certainly save lives, particularly of children who too often happen upon unlocked family handguns.

Instead, the governor has belittled the idea of smart-gun technology. The state’s 2002 smart-gun law requires gun stores to sell only smart guns three years after the technology enters the marketplace. But pressure from the gun lobby has prevented the development of such guns. The new measure is intended to spur research and development by relaxing the older law by allowing the sale of traditional handguns alongside the smart guns.

Jawbone is trying to retain employees by making sure they don’t lose money as part of this latest financing deal.
In order to do this, Jawbone said it would issue more shares to workers to make up for the reduced value of each share.
Last year, Jawbone laid off employees as part of a restructuring.
The company raised nearly $300 million in debt from the money management firm BlackRock last April.","['employees', 'money', 'round', 'raised', 'raises', 'company', 'million', 'private', '165', 'valuation', 'jawbone', 'valued', 'value', 'half']","Jawbone, the once-hot wearable technology start-up, said on Friday that it had raised $165 million in funding at a valuation of $1.5 billion, or roughly half the amount that the company was valued at as recently as 2014, continuing a burgeoning trend of start-ups raising money at lower values than before.

A Jawbone spokeswoman said the investment will be used to fund operations, growth and new product development, but she declined to comment on why the valuation had fallen. Recode previously reported the 16-year-old company’s funding and lower valuation.

When private companies raise money at a lower value than they had previously, the event is known as a “down round.” On Thursday, Foursquare announced it had raised a $45 million round of venture capital — which people familiar with the terms have said was also a down round, with Foursquare valued at $250 million, less than half of the $650 million it was valued at during its last round in 2013.

Down rounds are increasing as Silicon Valley sobers up somewhat after a frothy period. In the last quarter of 2015, there was a major investment slowdown; funding to private companies dropped 30 percent from the previous quarter, to $27.3 billion, the research firm CB Insights said.

Mutual fund investors have also recently marked down the valuations of other high-profile private companies like Zenefits, Dropbox and Snapchat.

Down rounds, like the ones that Jawbone and Foursquare have raised, tend to destroy value for all of the pre-existing shareholders, including employees who own the company’s private stock.

In order to do this, Jawbone said it would issue more shares to workers to make up for the reduced value of each share. This also increases their ownership stakes in the company by at least 25 percent, the spokeswoman said.

Employees at Jawbone, as at most start-ups, have to work at a company for a certain period of time before they have the right to own their stock, a process known as vesting. Jawbone said the new stock it will issue to employees who have already earned the rights to their old stock will be fully vested, meaning they don’t have to stay at the company for an even longer period before they can own the new stock.

It has been a tumultuous year for Jawbone, which is based in San Francisco. The company’s Up fitness band line faces stiff competition in a crowded market for wearable technology that is dominated by Fitbit and Apple, according to the research firm IDC.

Last year, Jawbone laid off employees as part of a restructuring. The company raised nearly $300 million in debt from the money management firm BlackRock last April.",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/jawbone-raises-165-million-at-half-its-last-valuation/

Can video games and the Internet be addictive? Are teenagers, especially young men, particularly susceptible? And if Internet addiction is real, what kinds of treatment methods would be most effective to provide help to those who need it? These are some of the tough questions the short documentary “China’s Web Junkies” investigates.

Shosh Shlam and Hilla Medalia write:

Compulsive Internet use has been categorized as a mental health issue in many countries, including the United States, but China was among the first to label “Internet addiction” a clinical disorder. In this Op-Doc video, we show the inner workings of a rehabilitation center where Chinese teenagers are “deprogrammed.” The Internet Addiction Treatment Center, in Daxing, a suburb of Beijing, was established in 2004. It was one of the first of its kind — and there are now hundreds of treatment programs throughout China and South Korea. (The first inpatient Internet addiction program in the United States recently opened in Pennsylvania.) The program featured in this video admits teenagers, usually male, whose parents typically take them there against their will. Once inside, the children are kept behind bars and guarded by soldiers. Treatment, which often lasts three to four months, includes medication and therapy, and sometimes includes parents. Patients undergo military-inspired physical training, and their sleep and diet are carefully regulated. These techniques (some of which are also used in China to treat other behavioral disorders) are intended to help the patients reconnect with reality. Yet after four months of filming in this center (for our documentary “Web Junkie”), some vital questions remained: Are the children being accurately evaluated? And is the treatment effective? In many cases, it seemed parents were blaming the Internet for complex social and behavioral issues that may defy such interventions. (For example, we noticed that some patients experienced difficult family relationships, social introversion and a lack of friends in the physical world.) Tao Ran, the center’s director, claims a 70 percent success rate. If that’s true, perhaps China’s treatment model is something other nations should embrace, however disturbing it may seem to outsiders. There is still no real global consensus among experts about what constitutes addiction to the Internet, and whether the concept even exists, particularly in a strict medical sense. What is clear is that this issue is not confined to China. With millions (if not billions) glued to screens and electronic devices, the overuse of technology is becoming a universal, transnational concern. While treatment methods may vary, one way or another, we will need to find effective ways to moderate our use of technology and provide help to those who need it.

Some Optional Discussion Questions

What moments in this film stood out for you? Why?

Were there any surprises? Anything that challenged what you know — or thought you knew?

What reaction do you have to the images of the Internet treatment addiction center in the film? What does the center remind you of? Why?

Do you think Internet addiction is a real disorder that requires treatment? Do young people experience “screen addiction” here in the United States?

Are there other reasons, besides addiction, that young people might spend so much time playing video games and using the Internet? The center’s director, in a lecture to parents, says loneliness is a factor. What do you think?

Do you think the boot camp-style treatment being used at the center will be successful? Why?

What messages, emotions or ideas will you take away from this film? Why?

Additional Resources

For more information, you can read Jane E. Brody’s article connecting Internet addiction in China with the situation in the United States. She writes:

While Internet addiction is not yet considered a clinical diagnosis here, there’s no question that American youths are plugged in and tuned out of “live” action for many more hours of the day than experts consider healthy for normal development. And it starts early, often with preverbal toddlers handed their parents’ cellphones and tablets to entertain themselves when they should be observing the world around them and interacting with their caregivers.

Gorman, Morgan Stanley’s chief executive, on Tuesday, when the bank announces its 2015 financial results,

Nathaniel Popper writes in DealBook. After holding off on an overhaul, Mr. Gorman last month began to make the cuts that investors were pushing for. Its bond and commodity trading desks were the most problematic businesses and he announced plans to lay off about a quarter of the staff at the division, known as fixed income. There was also a shake-up in the fixed-income division’s management ranks. But investors already wonder whether the changes have come too late. Morgan’s Stanley’s stock has fallen more than its largest competitors’ since news of the cuts starting circulating. Mr. Gorman has been credited with steadying many parts of the company and leading a push into the more stable earnings of wealth management. But the stock price is lower than it was when he took over in January 2010. Wall Street is facing challenges from new regulations that have raised the cost of buying, selling and holding bonds, commodities, derivatives and currencies. Morgan Stanley is under particular pressure because Mr. Gorman has already been through four leadership teams in the fixed-income division. Returns from the company as a whole are below the amount that the bank is presumed to pay its shareholders for their money: 10 percent. If it were not for the fixed-income business, returns would be comfortably above that. The bond-trading business, however, increases the level of equity and capital that the bank has to maintain. People briefed on the firm’s thinking said that Mr. Gorman did not move sooner partly because he did not anticipate the Federal Reserve’s continuing efforts to increase capital requirements for large banks.

FOURSQUARE RAISES $45 MILLION AND CUTS ITS VALUATION | Foursquare was ahead of the pack by creating a social app that used location technology, and now it is at the front of the wave of tech start-ups raising money at lower valuations,

Mike Isaac reports in DealBook. Foursquare said on Thursday that it had raised $45 million in new venture funding. The latest round of fund-raising valued the company at about half of the roughly $650 million that it was valued at in 2013, said people with knowledge of the terms of the deal. Foursquare is likely to be joined by other start-ups doing what are known as “down rounds,” accepting funding at lower values, with fears that some tech start-ups were ahead of themselves with their soaring valuations. Recode and TechCrunch had earlier reported that Foursquare was raising a down round. Foursquare’s plunge in valuation also reflects how the buzz around the company has faded, something acknowledged by Dennis Crowley, the founder and chief executive, who is stepping down to be executive chairman. “Everyone thought we were going to be the company that toppled Facebook, which is crazy talk,” Mr. Crowley said. Jeff Glueck, the chief operating officer who is being promoted to chief executive, added: “To raise $45 million in this environment, and on very employee-friendly terms, is a testament to the real business we have.”

GOLDMAN TO PAY UP TO $5 BILLION TO SETTLE FAULTY MORTGAGE CLAIMS | Goldman is again paying the price for its role in the financial crisis, seven years after the worst of it,

Matthew Goldstein reports in DealBook. The Wall Street firm said it had agreed to a civil settlement of up to $5 billion with federal prosecutors and regulators to resolve claims stemming from the marketing and selling of faulty mortgage securities to investors. Goldman, which reports its fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, said the settlement would reduce earnings in that period by about $1.5 billion on an after-tax basis. It had attracted criticism for making money by betting against the housing market in the run-up to the crisis. But its role in churning out faulty mortgages and securities backed by home loans to borrowers who could not afford them was smaller than that of other Wall Street firms, so its settlement is smaller than the sums paid by Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. The agreement requires Goldman to pay $2.385 billion in civil penalties and $875 million in cash, and provide up to $1.8 billion in relief to consumers. The settlement comes after the $3 billion that Goldman paid to the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2014 to settle claims over the sale of flawed mortgage securities. It also paid $550 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission for its role in putting together a collateralized debt obligation called Abacus.

‘Letters From Anne and Martin’ (Thursday) Anne Frank and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. never met, but they both knew what it was like to be denied freedom, to endure constant danger and to believe passionately in ideals that seemed elusive in the times they lived in. This play, compiled by Hannah Vaughn, draws directly on Frank’s diary and on Dr. King’s “Letter From a Birmingham Jail,” illustrating the parallels in their lives. Recommended for children over 10, the performance will be followed by a discussion with the cast and with Spirit Trickey, a community activist who will talk about her mother, Minnijean Brown Trickey, who was one of the nine students involved in the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School in 1957.

The place to try on these identities is the latest MoMA Art Lab, intended not only to acquaint young visitors with the works in the museum’s collection but also to help them relate to the methods and meanings behind them. The space explores the artistic process through stations where children can, for example, imitate Kelly’s gridlike designs or recreate and reinterpret a Nevelson sculpture. There are also opportunities to sketch a still life, design a chair, work with unusual materials and listen to tapes of artists discussing their work. (Through Aug. 31.)

Ms. Speier’s proposal comes amid two high-profile incidents of accusations against male university professors. Last fall, Geoffrey Marcy, a prominent astronomer at Berkeley resigned after he was found guilty of sexually harassing students in a campus investigation.

On Tuesday, Science, Nature and BuzzFeed reported a case involving a California Institute of Technology professor placed on unpaid leave for “unambiguous gender-based harassment.”

Ms. Speier envisions rules that would ensure better information sharing between universities about problem professors. “We’re developing legislation that would first require that any investigation at one university where the professor either resigns or is fired, that information would follow them,” she said in an interview with Wired.

On the House floor, beside a poster of the moon with the words “Stop Sexism in Science!,” Ms. Speier said, “Some universities protect predatory professors with slaps on the wrist and secrecy just like the Catholic Church protected child molesting for many decades.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/science/stories-spill-out-as-spotlight-is-shined-on-sexism-in-astronomy.html

And back in September, a crowd waiting on Fifth Avenue to see Pope Francis roll by discovered that Mr. Trump was watching from an upper floor of Trump Tower.

Mr. Trump’s values are about one person.","['campaign', 'york', 'mr', 'cruz', 'taken', 'servants', 'trumps', 'trump', 'feud', 'donald', 'politician', 'office', 'money', 'ted', 'familiar']","But enough about public policy.

Let’s put aside the financial benedictions New York has bestowed on Mr. Cruz’s presidential quest: the $11 million Mercer donation to the Cruz PAC, as well as the December fund-raising gathering at the Madison Avenue offices of the Sullivan & Cromwell law firm, or the undisclosed $1 million in loans, including money from Goldman Sachs and Citibank, to Mr. Cruz’s successful 2012 Senate campaign. It bears repeating: Hypocrisy is more widely practiced than any religion or creed.

The subject here, after all, is not hypocrisy but the villainy of embodying New York values.

In 2013, Mr. Mercer was sued in federal court by the servants on the domestic staff of his Long Island home, who said they were docked pay and bonuses if the toiletries fell below one-third full, or when they failed to stock bathrooms with extra towels. The suit was “amicably” settled, a lawyer for the servants told The New York Times.

It is one thing for a politician to take campaign money from people who pore over federal code to get around $6 billion in taxes.

It is quite another to be the creation of someone who may have calculated monetary punishments for people who did not swab the toilets to his specifications.

Representative King has spoken warmly of Mr. Trump and openly encouraged his participation in the Republican primaries. But even Mr. King, who has taken a hard line on Muslims in America, claiming that they were insufficiently diligent in cooperating with the police, has taken exception to Mr. Trump’s call to ban immigration by Muslims.

A couple of years ago, at the screening of a documentary at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, Mr. Trump’s face briefly flickered across the screen. It was as if the bad guy wrestler had just climbed into the ring: The auditorium erupted in jeers, hoots and boos. And back in September, a crowd waiting on Fifth Avenue to see Pope Francis roll by discovered that Mr. Trump was watching from an upper floor of Trump Tower. There were boos aplenty, according to reporters on the scene. Mr. Trump has never run for office in New York City, and with good reason. Mr. Trump’s values are about one person. The city is just a prop, like the campaign and everything else.

It is just another week at the office when some politician uses New York as a straw man for his or her dumb prejudices. Things have reached a far greater level of injury, however, when the likes of Donald Trump are anointed the standard-bearer of our tribe.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/nyregion/ted-cruz-and-donald-trumps-familiar-feud-over-new-york.html

It is probably because you have not sat where I sit. So, kindly cease communication with me.”

I have no doubt that colleges, especially those that do not have endowments big enough to meet the full financial needs of each accepted student, are worried about the consequences of “direct financial comparisons.” But to deliberately throw up roadblocks that prevent easy comparisons is to turn up an institution’s collective nose at anyone with even the mildest pecuniary concerns.

Many of these schools would much prefer that prospective students spend far more time on their individual websites and use each of their calculators one by one. There, the colleges can surround the results with sunny explainers and Instagram-worthy pictures. They are selling an expensive product, after all, and have strict goals to meet for each class. They are increasingly focused on numbers, carefully calibrating their aid offers to make sure that the average amount paid by members of the freshman class hits a specific financial target. (Even if the schools are “so much more than that.”)

But that is no excuse for standing in the way of making the process easier for families. If the schools worry that students will abandon their research based on an unfriendly result from College Abacus’s calculator, they are probably selling most families short. Given the magnitude of the financial decision, complete with teary-eyed teenagers who set their hearts on an expensive dream school, of course the families will approach the schools directly for more information. Often, they’ll come in search of a different, better financial answer.

Moreover, schools that stand in the way of making data easier to use are failing to recognize families’ desperation for numbers that can help them make comparisons. If you want to know how much your child might learn, how much happier they might be, what kind of relationships they might forge, well, good luck. Maybe it’s impossible to get good data to answer those questions. Or perhaps most colleges simply aren’t tracking or publicizing such things, with few exceptions.

The results of the net price calculators, however, are there for all to see, if only because the federal government forced the schools’ hands. And those schools that deliberately make it harder for families to compare their net prices are sending their own telling signal to the marketplace of applicants.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/16/your-money/concealing-the-calculus-of-higher-education.html

Yet rising competition from Chinese manufacturers and slowing growth there have had a mixed impact on Taiwan tech since.

Taiwan electronics exports have been falling since February 2015, and in the third quarter, the country’s gross domestic product contracted partly because of weakness in the tech sector.

As voters went to the polls and elected a new president over the weekend, a rare point of agreement between Taiwan’s fractious political parties was that the tech industry needs help. Just days before the election four years ago, major Taiwan tech figures took to television to argue that the policies of the incumbent president, Ma Ying-jeou, to improve relations with China would lift the industry.

Yet rising competition from Chinese manufacturers and slowing growth there have had a mixed impact on Taiwan tech since. With the Democratic Progressive Party’s Tsai Ing-wen — who won a decisive victory in the presidential election on Saturday — vowing to renew Taiwanese innovation and build out a new tech hub here, a crucial part of Taiwan’s immediate political future depends on whether it can be turned around.

Taiwan’s tech problem, as Mr. Lin sees it, is the result of a culture and government that have failed to generate the talent and flexibility to move beyond the manufacturing prowess that made the island a tech hub in the 1980s and ’90s and forward to the software and Internet industries driving Silicon Valley’s current boom. The dilemma became apparent to him in 2009 when he saw a commercial for Apple’s iPhone.

“The commercial said whatever you want to do, there’s an app for that,” Mr. Lin said. “Immediately, I realized that’s the end of Taiwan. We’re so good at making cheap computers and phones, but we’re so bad at making an app for anything.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/16/technology/in-taiwan-survivor-mentality-stymies-tech-innovation.html

On Sunday, Mr. Hastings remained upbeat about the challenges ahead.

MUNICH — Just hours after Reed Hastings announced this month that Netflix, the video-streaming service that he co-founded, would become available in 190 countries, he got an unexpected surprise.

Along with new customers in large markets like India and Russia, Mr. Hastings said, people on Réunion Island — a small French-governed island off the coast of Madagascar — were some of the first to sign up as new subscribers, making them maybe the most unlikely people to try Netflix’s fast-expanding global service.

“They must have pretty good Internet connections,” Mr. Hastings joked in an interview here on Sunday at DLD, a technology and media conference. “We saw a lot of people signing up there.”

Fulfilling the needs of these new customers — in out-of-the-way places like Réunion Island, along with more populous countries like Indonesia — is now a top priority for Mr. Hastings, whose goal is to turn Netflix into a global media giant.

That involves signing deals for local-language content in many of the countries where Netflix has just arrived, funding new programming in Japanese and other languages and offering subtitles for non-English speakers who want to get their fix of “Orange Is the New Black” or “House of Cards,” two of the company’s popular American shows.

“We have a lot of work to do to add more languages,” Mr. Hastings said, adding that the company would add roughly a couple of new languages a year as part of its global introduction. In many of the 190 countries where Netflix is now available — including Turkey and Poland — the service is available in English, but not the local language.

“We’re seeing sign-ups in places like Somalia,” he said. “It’s incredible to see.” That shows, he added, “how the Internet is truly global.”

Despite his lofty global ambitions, Mr. Hastings still has his work cut out to persuade people, particularly in developing countries, to spend roughly $7.50 a month for the video-on-demand service, a price that may prove too high for many potential subscribers.

Netflix must also overcome a growing number of local rivals, many of which have mimicked the company’s business model to offer subscription on-demand programming, often in national languages, to quench people’s thirst for content obtained over the Internet.

On Sunday, Mr. Hastings remained upbeat about the challenges ahead. Netflix, he said, was not just competing with other video-on-demand services, but it also wanted to grab a few hours of people’s days when they could be watching television, reading a book or even sharing a glass of wine with friends.

“If we try to outdo local competitors, we can differentiate ourselves for our customers,” Mr. Hastings said. “We don’t have to win everyone’s viewing habits. We only have to win a few hours of people’s time.”",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/netflixs-expansion-attracts-some-unexpected-customers/

It’s hard to take a tough stand on an important but long-term issue in the face of so many near-term problems, amid worries that reducing emissions will weaken our global economic position and fears that other countries may cheat on their emissions targets.

Where science can help is to keep track of changes in the Earth system — this is a research and monitoring job, led by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and their counterparts elsewhere in the world — and use our increasingly powerful computer models to explore possible futures associated with proposed policies. The models will help us decide which approaches are practicable, trading off near-term impacts to the economy against longer-term impacts to the climate.

Ultimately, though, it will be up to the engineers and industrialists of the world to save us. They must come up with the new technologies and the means of implementing them. The technical and organizational challenges of solving the problems of clean energy generation, storage and distribution are enormous, and they must be solved within a few decades with minimum disruption to the global economy. This will likely entail a major switch to nuclear, solar and other renewable power, with an electrification of our transport system to the maximum extent possible. These engineers and industrialists are fully up to the job, given the right incentives and investments. You have only to look at what they achieved during World War II: American technology and production catapulted over what would have taken decades to do under ordinary conditions and presented us with a world in 1945 that was completely different from the late 1930s.

What should the rest of us do? Two things come to mind. First, we should brace for change. It is inevitable. It will appear in changes to the climate and to the way we generate and use energy. Second, we should be prepared to absorb these with appropriate sang-froid. Some will be difficult to deal with, like rising seas, but many others could be positive. New technologies have a way of bettering our lives in ways we cannot anticipate. There is no convincing, demonstrated reason to believe that our evolving future will be worse than our present, assuming careful management of the challenges and risks. History is replete with examples of us humans getting out of tight spots. The winners tended to be realistic, pragmatic and flexible; the losers were often in denial of the threat.

As for me, I’ve no complaints. I’m very grateful for the experiences I’ve had on this planet. As an astronaut I spacewalked 220 miles above the Earth. Floating alongside the International Space Station, I watched hurricanes cartwheel across oceans, the Amazon snake its way to the sea through a brilliant green carpet of forest, and gigantic nighttime thunderstorms flash and flare for hundreds of miles along the Equator.

Gavin Andresen, a close collaborator of Mr. Hearn’s and one of the longest-standing contributors to the Bitcoin software, said the dispute was likely to cause disruptions in the short term, but he disagrees with the notion that it will damage Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Other Bitcoin leaders have expressed a similar sentiment, and investors have been inclined to believe them: The price of a Bitcoin has actually risen in recent months, to about $430 this week.

Some of Mr. Hearn’s allies in the battle are hoping the deadlock can be broken if the largest Bitcoin companies get behind something like Bitcoin Classic, a new version of the basic Bitcoin software that was announced this week, and that aims to expand the network’s capacity while also introducing new standards of governance.

But Mr. Hearn is convinced it is already too late. During nighttime walks in the woods near his apartment in Zurich, he has been trying to figure out where Bitcoin went wrong and what it means for the idealistic beliefs that led him to the project in the first place.

“It never occurred to me that the thing could just fall apart because of people getting crazy and having fundamental political disagreements over the goals of the project,” Mr. Hearn said in a Skype interview from his apartment. “It’s really shaken my faith in humanity.”

An Early Advocate

Mr. Hearn, 31, grew up in Manchester, England, where he played music and went rock climbing in his free time. He was one of the first serious programmers to take an interest in Bitcoin, back in April 2009, just a few months after its mysterious founder, known as Satoshi Nakamoto, let it loose in the world.

At the time, Mr. Hearn was working on mapping software at Google, a job he’d had since graduating from Durham University, in England. He had no professional involvement with finance or currencies, but the financial crisis convinced him that national currencies were vulnerable to politics and bad decision-making. When a web search led him to the primitive website for Bitcoin, he immediately emailed Satoshi, as the founder had become known.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/business/dealbook/the-bitcoin-believer-who-gave-up.html

Uber is perhaps the seminal harbinger of that change; take one well-entrenched industry (taxi and livery service) with a corner on the market and no need for innovation. Add one start-up with a clever, convenient approach and a willingness to flout laws. Pour millions of dollars on idea. Repeat.

So while things like food delivery or on-demand office cleaning or whatever are certainly not as world-changing and attractive as robot monkey butlers, it is pretty much par for what Silicon Valley stands for: the destruction of the old in the name of efficiency and expediency.

Farhad: Wait, wait, wait. Are you saying that not only is someone working on robot monkey butlers but that they will be attractive robot monkey butlers? Take my money!

She has also emphasized the importance of expanding Taiwan’s trade ties globally.

Mr. Chu, the Kuomintang candidate, argued that Taiwan needed to focus on trade and investment ties with China to revive its economy. That approach met with skepticism among voters worried about the possibility that China would use economic leverage to pursue its goal of bringing the island under its control.

Those concerns were reinforced on the eve of the election. Chou Tzu-yu, a 16-year-old Taiwanese member of a South Korean pop group, who has been criticized over a photo in which she is shown holding Taiwan’s flag, bowed in apology in a video released by her agency. In the video, she declares, “There is only one China,” and “I have always felt proud to be Chinese.”

All three presidential candidates, including a third-party candidate, James Soong, said Ms. Chou should not have had to apologize. But many online critics derided Kuomintang politicians’ expressions of support as hypocritical, given the party’s push for closer China ties.

The party’s campaign struggled in other ways, too. No prominent politician stepped forward to run against Ms. Tsai, and as the Kuomintang’s initial nominee, Hung Hsiu-chu, trailed badly in the polls, she was replaced in October by Mr. Chu, the party secretary.

But Mr. Chu fared little better. His chances were further weakened by the candidacy of Mr. Soong, of the People First Party, a former Kuomintang member who has run for president twice before.

Analysts expected the D.P.P. to make strong gains in Taiwan’s legislature and perhaps win control of it for the first time.

WILLIAM MANTIS

St. Paul

A major obstacle to constitutional reform and greater flexibility in the interpretation and application of the Constitution is the belief by many Americans, and the doctrine of some American religions, that its creation was inspired by God, and consequently a perfect document of perpetual applicability.

Those founding fathers who composed and ratified it considered it the best they could produce to meet the needs of the time and of the future insofar as they could see it. The most gifted of them could not have imagined our world of today. Other nations with written constitutions often revamp them as changing times demand. Arguably, we should do the same, though always with careful, thoughtful deliberation and never in haste.

JOHN C. FRANDSEN

Auburn, Ala.

Some so-called conservatives claim that the Constitution should be read only in the most constricted manner possible and that amendments are the only legitimate means to resolve vital new questions. Should those brittle prescriptions ever be broadly adopted, their folly would soon be evident, but not before risking our entire legal system, if not the Republic. Even if the arduous amendment process could be made to address every unforeseen issue, our Constitution would become ever longer and more complicated, its great principles diluted until one day it would be a broken-down pile of words on its way to the scrap heap of history. Yet these ideas are “conservative”?

BRAD WHEELER

Lewisville, Tex.

The Writer Responds

As usual, I am struck by the incisive comments of New York Times readers. I did not mean to imply, as Mr. Maitland suggests, that the founding fathers were in any way afraid of change or in need of defense. It is their self-proclaimed literalist disciples of today that concern me. As Judge Harris writes, the founders purposely designed a document that can “live, breathe and adapt” to changes that they could have never foreseen. The specific questions aptly posed by Mr. Mantis are ones that thankfully the Constitution gives us the flexibility to confront “with careful, thoughtful deliberation and never in haste,” just as Mr. Frandsen proposes.

I do not, however, share Mr. Wheeler’s fear that the amendment process could one day leave the Constitution a “broken-down pile of words” for “the scrap heap of history.” Instead, at least for the time being, I take heart in President Obama’s full embrace in his State of the Union speech of “change that’s reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet and our place in the world.”

THE UNFINISHED WORLD

And Other Stories

By Amber Sparks

226 pp. Liveright, paper, $15.95.

Sparks’s stylish second collection is the work of a young writer whose voice feels far wiser than her years, as she engages with ancient themes: the Greek myths, the rituals of death, the small tokens that lovers trade over a lifetime of experience. Sparks has no fidelity to realism; she plays with both fantasy and form. No one story sounds like another, yet her singular voice floats through the collection, tying it together with opulent prose that draws heavily on history and the macabre. In “And the World Was Crowded With Things That Meant Love,” she writes about the eccentric trinkets that a man and woman send back and forth for decades as signs of affection. The entire story sounds like a swoon: “A paper heart, coin-sized and inked in scarlet. He kept it in his pocket until it fell to pieces.”

Sparks’s strongest writing comes when she pushes her imagination into unexpected structures. “Thirteen Ways of Destroying a Painting” is a time-travel fable in list form. She also hits her stride when she departs from reality altogether, creating mythological characters of her own. In “The Fever Librarian,” Sparks writes about a woman who works alone in a card catalog of human fevers, and the prose correspondingly reaches a fever pitch. “Here she is,” Sparks writes, “with gallons, with buckets, with fire hoses of water to put out these fevers and drown all our passions and finally, finally send them back to the sea from whence all our troubles are come.”

CRIMINALS

Love Stories

By Valerie Trueblood

245 pp. Counterpoint, paper, $16.95.

Trueblood’s love stories are the kind that become love stories only halfway through — they all begin with some act of cruelty or confusion that exposes the dark, rather than the romantic, side of human nature. They become love stories only in acts of redemption and release, with a complexity that reveals Trueblood’s keen eye for the nuances of connection. In “You Would Be Good,” a woman’s ex-boyfriend breaks into the house where she is staying just to see her one more time, only to discover that earlier that evening she was in a car accident that left her in a coma. His initial crime is never discovered, and instead he bonds with his ex’s sister over their mutual loss. This turn of events raises the question: Can an act of love begin as an act of violence? Can a criminal’s actions swerve into the redemptive?",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/books/review/short-stories.html

Many parents find themselves trying, and often failing, to legislate phone use at the table and at bedtime.

I remember the first time one of my children texted me a photo of a skin lesion. It was not a photo of my own child’s skin, but that of a college roommate’s, and the message was something like: “Hi, Mom, is this anything to worry about?”

There was no identifying information — I couldn’t actually tell what part of the body I was looking at — and there was certainly no medical history (a 19-year-old in generally good health has had this mark on the arm for a week and it seems to be getting bigger but it doesn’t hurt if you press on it … that kind of thing). I tried to take it as a tribute — friends sitting around a dorm room, showing one another funny lumps and bumps, and up speaks my offspring: “Oh, my mom will be able to tell you what that is!”

The intensity with which teenagers live on and through their phones is hardly news. Many parents find themselves trying, and often failing, to legislate phone use at the table and at bedtime. So going away to college does mean, among many forms of independence, phone freedom.

Telemedicine has been much in the news as researchers investigate how technology can extend the reach of medical services, and a host of start-ups and app developers look for ways to incorporate medical care into our relationships with our devices. And so in pediatrics, there is discussion about the potential for making health part of that adolescent connectedness.

Some research shows that adolescents are open to at least certain aspects of medical care delivered by phone, and a variety of efforts are underway to incorporate texting into health and mental health services for adolescents, to extend the reach of counseling services, and even to provide help to teenagers in crisis. Some studies have shown that teenagers with chronic medical issues, including liver transplants and Type 1 diabetes, may follow their health regimens better when they get text reminders.

It’s a truism in pediatrics that teenagers are often frustratingly vague about their symptoms — how long, how severe, getting better or worse. Their readiness to document their lives via cellphone can be highly useful since what used to be hard-to-pin-down stories in the office are now often illustrated. “Even when it’s not long-distance communication, it improves communication because they think to use the phone to take a picture of the rash that they can show you when they come in to see you,” said Dr. Cindy Osman, a clinical associate professor of pediatrics at New York University.

It also seems to be a truism in pediatrics that parents who work in medical fields develop a strong sense of what you can diagnose by text and by telephone. One pediatrician friend told me a story about getting a my-throat-hurts text from her college-age son and assuming it was a viral infection, likely to get better by itself, until he called and she heard his changed tone, and the amount of pain in his voice, and sent him to get the strep test he needed.

Miki Conrad, who worked as a critical care nurse in Olympia, Wash., for 35 years, has four children, now in their 20s and 30s, who have been texting her with their medical questions, and sending photos, since they left for college. “They sent a lot of photos — oh, I kicked so and so in the shin, look at my toe,” she said. “And then pretty soon they started to send photos of their friends’ rashes, injuries.”

Patrick K. FitzGerald, the vice president for entrepreneurship and innovation at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said that “to some degree we are all self-diagnosing nowadays,” using various sites and tools on the Internet. The question, he told me, is how hospitals can incorporate that into their patient care “so people are getting the right care at the right price.”

Dr. James P. Marcin, a pediatric critical care specialist at the University of California, Davis, was the lead author on last summer’s American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on telemedicine and how it can be used to improve access to care for children. The recommendations included a general push in the direction of reducing barriers, increasing research, and compensating physicians who provide medical care through devices, along with warnings about the dangers of fragmented medical care.

“Adolescents live on and through these devices, and people are trying to evaluate the pros and cons of doing medically related activities on these devices with a lot of varying success,” Dr. Marcin said, pointing to sites that allow teenagers to discuss how they live with chronic diseases, while warning that these might not always offer the most reliable advice. “I think that as providers, we need to work with the developers of these technologies and the teenagers we’re trying to serve to come up with something that works better for them.”

And yes, there are worries about the kinds of misinformation you can find, and worries about medical information and privacy, Dr. Marcin told me, but it’s also important that doctors, worrying about these risks, not find themselves left behind by adolescents, who are already accustomed to living their lives on the Internet. “They are on it and they are using it and it would behoove us to find a conceptual framework to give them the power to help themselves and help others.”

Ms. Conrad, whose children are athletic, has diagnosed broken toes from texted photos, and reviewed photos of turf burn from indoor soccer. She has also diagnosed something more serious over the phone when her son called from his dorm to say he had been sick for a couple of days and couldn’t walk right — and she could hear that his speech was slurred. He ended up in the emergency room with mononucleosis.

“They’re not kids who call me every day or text me every day,” she said. “I almost welcome their little gross photos of things — it made me know they were doing O.K., and they did know if they had some kind of physical problem they could just call.”

I feel the same way, I guess — grateful for the photos, even when they serve as a slightly awkward introduction to some piece of a roommate, or a kid across the hall — and, though I often end up saying, “If it’s really bothering you, you might want to let a real person take a look.”

The question of whether the state’s largess can foster economic revitalization is a recurring issue in ailing upstate communities.

The region has added 9,300 private jobs in the same period.
“Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts,” the spokesman, Richard Azzopardi, said.","['york', 'projects', 'hiring', 'added', 'syracuse', 'surround', 'private', 'economic', 'upstate', 'state', 'unemployment', 'subsidies', 'local', 'cuomo', 'jobs', 'questions', 'project']","By taking aim at the state, Ms. Miner has added a chapter to her long-running clash with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat, over his upstate economic policies, which rely heavily on state funds to create new factories, technology centers and other major projects designed to generate jobs. Once an ally, Ms. Miner has emerged as one of the governor’s most blunt critics.

The question of whether the state’s largess can foster economic revitalization is a recurring issue in ailing upstate communities.

“This is not rocket science,” said Richard L. Brodsky, a former state assemblyman who has long criticized the use of tax deals to promote private development. “If the taxpayer is going to subsidize these projects, the taxpayer needs to see a return, and they’re not getting much back for their tax dollars. There’s a growing sense that you cannot subsidize your way into economic progress.”

Calls for reform have not gone unheeded: Last month, Mr. Cuomo signed legislation subjecting industrial development agencies to greater scrutiny. The agencies will be required to adopt a uniform contract that allows them to revoke tax incentives if projects do not produce the jobs that have been promised.

From the state’s point of view, subsidies have translated into real economic progress. A spokesman for the governor said the unemployment rate had dropped to 4.7 percent statewide in November, its lowest level since November 2007, and that New York State had added 759,300 private jobs since Mr. Cuomo took office. In central New York, the region around Syracuse, unemployment has fallen from 8.3 percent before Mr. Cuomo took office to 4.9 percent in November, according to figures provided by the governor’s office. The region has added 9,300 private jobs in the same period.

“Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts,” the spokesman, Richard Azzopardi, said. “Unemployment is down across upstate New York, and private sector jobs are up.” In a jab at Syracuse officials, he added that the state had the highest standard for contracting with minority and female-owned businesses in the country — “much higher than the City of Syracuse, which also has no consistent policy for local hires on city projects.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/18/nyregion/syracuse-sues-major-developer-over-local-hiring-and-tax-breaks.html

The thousands of refugees who continue to arrive in Europe each day face barriers: not only physical barriers — walls, fences, barbed wire — but an even deeper resistance, in the nationalism and xenophobia bubbling up across the Continent.

After World War II, Levinas’s abiding concern was to describe the concrete source of ethical relations between human beings: our ability to respond to the wants and needs of others.

A handful of recent events — Islamic State attacks in Istanbul, Paris and elsewhere, as well as the mass assault of women in Cologne, Germany, on New Year’s Eve — continue to feed a deep-seated and often irrational fear of the “other.” And then there is the debate about refugees coming to the United States, where a nationalist sentiment has also emerged, often in the rhetoric of certain presidential candidates.

Now, in Germany and elsewhere, doors are closing. But what are the potential consequences of this resistance to outsiders, to those in need? Is it justified? Do we owe the suffering and dispossessed something more, if we are to call ourselves ethical beings?

Few philosophers confronted questions like these more directly than Emmanuel Levinas. Born into a Jewish family in Kaunas, Lithuania, in 1906, Levinas moved to France in 1923 and studied philosophy in Germany under Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger in the late 1920s. Levinas made a name for himself in the 1930s as one of the first interpreters and defenders of Husserl’s and Heidegger’s phenomenology in France, but his commitment to and understanding of phenomenology’s often arcane search for the meaning of being was transformed during the Second World War. Levinas was drafted into the French Army in 1939. He was taken prisoner by the Nazis in 1940. And while his status as an officer saved him from being sent to the concentration camps, all the members of his immediate family were killed by the Nazis for their Jewish faith and ancestry.



After the war, Levinas’s abiding concern was to describe the concrete source of ethical relations between human beings: our ability to respond to the wants and needs of others.

The epigraph to Levinas’s “Otherwise Than Being” reads: “To the memory of those who were closest among the six million assassinated by the National Socialists, and of the millions upon millions of all confessions and all nations, victims of the same hatred of the other man, the same anti-semitism.” The book that follows is a profound meditation on the essence of exclusion. It is also an uncompromising account of a basic hospitality that constitutes our humanity. And Levinas’s extensive body of work has much to teach us about the nature and danger of nationalism as well as the necessity of welcoming and protecting vulnerable human beings.

Levinas traces the roots of virulent nationalism to the sharp distinctions we draw between ‘same’ and ‘other.’

Nationalism is the result of identification and differentiation and it follows from the similarities and differences we see between ourselves and others. As an American, you share the same upbringing with many of your fellow citizens. Your background is different than that of most Britons or Italians. And it is partially by recognizing the traits you share with Americans and then distinguishing them from citizens of other states that you develop your sense of identity. But as we know from history, this identity building, taken to extremes, can often lead to horrible things.

Levinas traces the roots of virulent nationalism to the sharp distinctions we draw between “same” and “other.” And while identification and differentiation enables the formation of personal identity, it can also result in hostility when the traits we use to distinguish ourselves from others are totalized and taken as absolute. “Totalization” occurs when members of one group take a feature of another group to be both definitive of that group and all members in it. Generalizations like “Americans are outgoing,” “Brits are reserved” and “Italians are passionate” are often unfairly applied to individual Americans, Britons or Italians. And negative stereotypes such as “Jews are greedy,” “Blacks are dangerous” and “Muslims are terrorists” have a history of leading to unjust aggression against members of those communities. In each of these examples, we reduce others to a simple or single category that distinguishes “them” from “us” in an absolute way. And this reduction often produces an allergic reaction to others; a reaction exemplified by the rush to build fences around Europe to keep Afghan, Iraqi and Syrian refugees out.

Levinas’s antihistamine for our allergic reactions involves three things: an appeal to the “infinity” in human beings, a detailed description of face-to-face encounters and an account of a basic hospitality that constitutes humanity.

Infinity is Levinas’s technical term for the idea that other people are always more than our categories can capture. You may be a British Anglican from the Midlands, but you’re much more than that. You are a father, a son and a husband. You have black hair, blue eyes and a graying beard. You have political opinions and controversial beliefs about the beginning of the world. And so on, ad infinitum.

Similarly, a Syrian refugee may be Muslim, but she’s much more than that! She is a mother, a daughter and a wife. She has black hair, brown eyes and a sharp jaw-line. She has political opinions and controversial beliefs about the beginning of the world. And so on, ad infinitum. By calling attention to this infinity in human beings, Levinas was trying to show us that our identifications and differentiations always fail as adequate descriptions of others. And he aims to interrupt our totalizing and xenophobic tendencies by indicating the irreducible humanity of other human beings.

Hospitality, welcoming and sharing are the foundation upon which all communities are formed, and is at the root of our basic humanity.

Concretely, the irreducible humanity of other human beings is found in the face. Faces confront us directly and immediately and they refuse typologies. Levinas indicates the irreducibility of others by speaking of God’s presence in the face, but his account of the face also illustrates another aspect of human beings: vulnerability. The face is naked, exposed, and open to attack. It is hungry and thirsty. And it seeks protection and nourishment. Levinas invokes the stranger, the widow and the orphan as examples of deprivation. We could also add asylum seekers and embattled exiles as acute cases of suffering. However, Levinas’s general account of vulnerability shows us how hospitality in the face of another’s need constitutes individual human beings and bespeaks a humanity that precedes and is more fundamental than the establishment of all national boundaries.

Hospitality, according to Levinas, involves curtailing our enjoyment of the world when confronted with another’s wants. It is exemplified by the act of welcoming another into our home and sharing our possessions. Welcoming and sharing with others determines who and what we are as specific human beings. Levinas expresses this idea in a discussion of subjectivity in which the self is described as a host and hostage to others. We are hosts to others because welcoming them into our world is a precondition for a relation of identification and differentiation between us. And we are hostages because our personal identity is determined by how we respond to the demands others place upon us.

For instance, your identity as an Italian high school teacher is achieved with your recognition and response to the fact that others want an education. Likewise, a Syrian man’s status as a trafficker of refugees is possible via his recognition and response to an exile’s need for safe passage across the sea. With these examples we discover that our place in a distinct human community is based on our ability to respond to the wants and needs of others. Yet Levinas shows us that hospitality not only determines our identities in specific communities but is also the mark of humanity — hospitality is the basis of human community as such.

The existence of distinct human communities presupposes our ability to welcome and share our property with others. “To recognize the other,” Levinas wrote in “Totality and Infinity,” “is to come to him across the world of possessed things, but at the same time to establish, by gift, community and universality.” Once our enjoyment of the world has been questioned by another’s need, hospitality establishes human community in the act of giving and with the creation of a common tongue. Language, Levinas wrote in his work,

is universal because it is the very passage from the individual to the general, because it offers things that are mine to the other. To speak is to make the world common, to create commonplaces. Language does not refer to the generality of concepts, but lays the foundations for a possession in common. It abolishes the inalienable property of enjoyment. The world in discourse is no longer what it is in separation, in the being at home with oneself where everything is given to me; it is what I give: the communicable, the thought, the universal.

While the creation of a common tongue is the basis of human community, language also allows us to label others and thus explicitly identify and distinguish our selves from them. This facilitates our tendency to overlook a face in need and see a “Syrian” or “Muslim” that is not like me. The foundation of a human community also raises the question of “other others” whereby any face-to-face encounter may be interrupted by the face of another. We are asked, in other words, to share our possessions with all human beings. Levinas sees this request as an infinite but impossible responsibility, since we could give what we have to anyone, but we do not have enough to give to all. In the face of this impossible responsibility we require justice: the systematic organization and distribution of resources amongst human beings. And from here we are not far from the formation of nation states with rigid identities and physical boundaries and the barbed-wire resistance with which we began.

Although we seem to have come full circle, Levinas has taught us that our responsibility for others is the foundation of all human communities, and that the very possibility of living in a meaningful human world is based on our ability to give what we can to others. And since welcoming and sharing are the foundation upon which all communities are formed, no amount of inhospitable nationalism can be consistently defended when confronted with the suffering of other human beings. “In the relationship between same and other, my welcoming of the other is,” as Levinas puts it, “the ultimate fact.” It is the hospitality of humanity, or a peace prior to all hostility. And in this primary peace, in this basic welcoming of refugees, Levinas reminds us that “things figure not as what one builds but as what one gives.”

The thousands of refugees who continue to arrive in Europe each day face barriers: not only physical barriers — walls, fences, barbed wire — but an even deeper resistance, in the nationalism and xenophobia bubbling up across the Continent.

After World War II, Levinas’s abiding concern was to describe the concrete source of ethical relations between human beings: our ability to respond to the wants and needs of others.

A handful of recent events — Islamic State attacks in Istanbul, Paris and elsewhere, as well as the mass assault of women in Cologne, Germany, on New Year’s Eve — continue to feed a deep-seated and often irrational fear of the “other.” And then there is the debate about refugees coming to the United States, where a nationalist sentiment has also emerged, often in the rhetoric of certain presidential candidates.

Now, in Germany and elsewhere, doors are closing. But what are the potential consequences of this resistance to outsiders, to those in need? Is it justified? Do we owe the suffering and dispossessed something more, if we are to call ourselves ethical beings?

Few philosophers confronted questions like these more directly than Emmanuel Levinas. Born into a Jewish family in Kaunas, Lithuania, in 1906, Levinas moved to France in 1923 and studied philosophy in Germany under Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger in the late 1920s. Levinas made a name for himself in the 1930s as one of the first interpreters and defenders of Husserl’s and Heidegger’s phenomenology in France, but his commitment to and understanding of phenomenology’s often arcane search for the meaning of being was transformed during the Second World War. Levinas was drafted into the French Army in 1939. He was taken prisoner by the Nazis in 1940. And while his status as an officer saved him from being sent to the concentration camps, all the members of his immediate family were killed by the Nazis for their Jewish faith and ancestry.



After the war, Levinas’s abiding concern was to describe the concrete source of ethical relations between human beings: our ability to respond to the wants and needs of others.

The epigraph to Levinas’s “Otherwise Than Being” reads: “To the memory of those who were closest among the six million assassinated by the National Socialists, and of the millions upon millions of all confessions and all nations, victims of the same hatred of the other man, the same anti-semitism.” The book that follows is a profound meditation on the essence of exclusion. It is also an uncompromising account of a basic hospitality that constitutes our humanity. And Levinas’s extensive body of work has much to teach us about the nature and danger of nationalism as well as the necessity of welcoming and protecting vulnerable human beings.

Levinas traces the roots of virulent nationalism to the sharp distinctions we draw between ‘same’ and ‘other.’

Nationalism is the result of identification and differentiation and it follows from the similarities and differences we see between ourselves and others. As an American, you share the same upbringing with many of your fellow citizens. Your background is different than that of most Britons or Italians. And it is partially by recognizing the traits you share with Americans and then distinguishing them from citizens of other states that you develop your sense of identity. But as we know from history, this identity building, taken to extremes, can often lead to horrible things.

Levinas traces the roots of virulent nationalism to the sharp distinctions we draw between “same” and “other.” And while identification and differentiation enables the formation of personal identity, it can also result in hostility when the traits we use to distinguish ourselves from others are totalized and taken as absolute. “Totalization” occurs when members of one group take a feature of another group to be both definitive of that group and all members in it. Generalizations like “Americans are outgoing,” “Brits are reserved” and “Italians are passionate” are often unfairly applied to individual Americans, Britons or Italians. And negative stereotypes such as “Jews are greedy,” “Blacks are dangerous” and “Muslims are terrorists” have a history of leading to unjust aggression against members of those communities. In each of these examples, we reduce others to a simple or single category that distinguishes “them” from “us” in an absolute way. And this reduction often produces an allergic reaction to others; a reaction exemplified by the rush to build fences around Europe to keep Afghan, Iraqi and Syrian refugees out.

Levinas’s antihistamine for our allergic reactions involves three things: an appeal to the “infinity” in human beings, a detailed description of face-to-face encounters and an account of a basic hospitality that constitutes humanity.

Infinity is Levinas’s technical term for the idea that other people are always more than our categories can capture. You may be a British Anglican from the Midlands, but you’re much more than that. You are a father, a son and a husband. You have black hair, blue eyes and a graying beard. You have political opinions and controversial beliefs about the beginning of the world. And so on, ad infinitum.

Similarly, a Syrian refugee may be Muslim, but she’s much more than that! She is a mother, a daughter and a wife. She has black hair, brown eyes and a sharp jaw-line. She has political opinions and controversial beliefs about the beginning of the world. And so on, ad infinitum. By calling attention to this infinity in human beings, Levinas was trying to show us that our identifications and differentiations always fail as adequate descriptions of others. And he aims to interrupt our totalizing and xenophobic tendencies by indicating the irreducible humanity of other human beings.

Hospitality, welcoming and sharing are the foundation upon which all communities are formed, and is at the root of our basic humanity.

Concretely, the irreducible humanity of other human beings is found in the face. Faces confront us directly and immediately and they refuse typologies. Levinas indicates the irreducibility of others by speaking of God’s presence in the face, but his account of the face also illustrates another aspect of human beings: vulnerability. The face is naked, exposed, and open to attack. It is hungry and thirsty. And it seeks protection and nourishment. Levinas invokes the stranger, the widow and the orphan as examples of deprivation. We could also add asylum seekers and embattled exiles as acute cases of suffering. However, Levinas’s general account of vulnerability shows us how hospitality in the face of another’s need constitutes individual human beings and bespeaks a humanity that precedes and is more fundamental than the establishment of all national boundaries.

The thousands of refugees who continue to arrive in Europe each day face barriers: not only physical barriers — walls, fences, barbed wire — but an even deeper resistance, in the nationalism and xenophobia bubbling up across the Continent.

After World War II, Levinas’s abiding concern was to describe the concrete source of ethical relations between human beings: our ability to respond to the wants and needs of others.

A handful of recent events — Islamic State attacks in Istanbul, Paris and elsewhere, as well as the mass assault of women in Cologne, Germany, on New Year’s Eve — continue to feed a deep-seated and often irrational fear of the “other.” And then there is the debate about refugees coming to the United States, where a nationalist sentiment has also emerged, often in the rhetoric of certain presidential candidates.

Now, in Germany and elsewhere, doors are closing. But what are the potential consequences of this resistance to outsiders, to those in need? Is it justified? Do we owe the suffering and dispossessed something more, if we are to call ourselves ethical beings?

Few philosophers confronted questions like these more directly than Emmanuel Levinas. Born into a Jewish family in Kaunas, Lithuania, in 1906, Levinas moved to France in 1923 and studied philosophy in Germany under Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger in the late 1920s. Levinas made a name for himself in the 1930s as one of the first interpreters and defenders of Husserl’s and Heidegger’s phenomenology in France, but his commitment to and understanding of phenomenology’s often arcane search for the meaning of being was transformed during the Second World War. Levinas was drafted into the French Army in 1939. He was taken prisoner by the Nazis in 1940. And while his status as an officer saved him from being sent to the concentration camps, all the members of his immediate family were killed by the Nazis for their Jewish faith and ancestry.



After the war, Levinas’s abiding concern was to describe the concrete source of ethical relations between human beings: our ability to respond to the wants and needs of others.

The epigraph to Levinas’s “Otherwise Than Being” reads: “To the memory of those who were closest among the six million assassinated by the National Socialists, and of the millions upon millions of all confessions and all nations, victims of the same hatred of the other man, the same anti-semitism.” The book that follows is a profound meditation on the essence of exclusion. It is also an uncompromising account of a basic hospitality that constitutes our humanity. And Levinas’s extensive body of work has much to teach us about the nature and danger of nationalism as well as the necessity of welcoming and protecting vulnerable human beings.

Levinas traces the roots of virulent nationalism to the sharp distinctions we draw between ‘same’ and ‘other.’

Nationalism is the result of identification and differentiation and it follows from the similarities and differences we see between ourselves and others. As an American, you share the same upbringing with many of your fellow citizens. Your background is different than that of most Britons or Italians. And it is partially by recognizing the traits you share with Americans and then distinguishing them from citizens of other states that you develop your sense of identity. But as we know from history, this identity building, taken to extremes, can often lead to horrible things.

Levinas traces the roots of virulent nationalism to the sharp distinctions we draw between “same” and “other.” And while identification and differentiation enables the formation of personal identity, it can also result in hostility when the traits we use to distinguish ourselves from others are totalized and taken as absolute. “Totalization” occurs when members of one group take a feature of another group to be both definitive of that group and all members in it. Generalizations like “Americans are outgoing,” “Brits are reserved” and “Italians are passionate” are often unfairly applied to individual Americans, Britons or Italians. And negative stereotypes such as “Jews are greedy,” “Blacks are dangerous” and “Muslims are terrorists” have a history of leading to unjust aggression against members of those communities. In each of these examples, we reduce others to a simple or single category that distinguishes “them” from “us” in an absolute way. And this reduction often produces an allergic reaction to others; a reaction exemplified by the rush to build fences around Europe to keep Afghan, Iraqi and Syrian refugees out.

Levinas’s antihistamine for our allergic reactions involves three things: an appeal to the “infinity” in human beings, a detailed description of face-to-face encounters and an account of a basic hospitality that constitutes humanity.

Infinity is Levinas’s technical term for the idea that other people are always more than our categories can capture. You may be a British Anglican from the Midlands, but you’re much more than that. You are a father, a son and a husband. You have black hair, blue eyes and a graying beard. You have political opinions and controversial beliefs about the beginning of the world. And so on, ad infinitum.

Similarly, a Syrian refugee may be Muslim, but she’s much more than that! She is a mother, a daughter and a wife. She has black hair, brown eyes and a sharp jaw-line. She has political opinions and controversial beliefs about the beginning of the world. And so on, ad infinitum. By calling attention to this infinity in human beings, Levinas was trying to show us that our identifications and differentiations always fail as adequate descriptions of others. And he aims to interrupt our totalizing and xenophobic tendencies by indicating the irreducible humanity of other human beings.

Hospitality, welcoming and sharing are the foundation upon which all communities are formed, and is at the root of our basic humanity.

Concretely, the irreducible humanity of other human beings is found in the face. Faces confront us directly and immediately and they refuse typologies. Levinas indicates the irreducibility of others by speaking of God’s presence in the face, but his account of the face also illustrates another aspect of human beings: vulnerability. The face is naked, exposed, and open to attack. It is hungry and thirsty. And it seeks protection and nourishment. Levinas invokes the stranger, the widow and the orphan as examples of deprivation. We could also add asylum seekers and embattled exiles as acute cases of suffering. However, Levinas’s general account of vulnerability shows us how hospitality in the face of another’s need constitutes individual human beings and bespeaks a humanity that precedes and is more fundamental than the establishment of all national boundaries.

Hospitality, according to Levinas, involves curtailing our enjoyment of the world when confronted with another’s wants. It is exemplified by the act of welcoming another into our home and sharing our possessions. Welcoming and sharing with others determines who and what we are as specific human beings. Levinas expresses this idea in a discussion of subjectivity in which the self is described as a host and hostage to others. We are hosts to others because welcoming them into our world is a precondition for a relation of identification and differentiation between us. And we are hostages because our personal identity is determined by how we respond to the demands others place upon us.

For instance, your identity as an Italian high school teacher is achieved with your recognition and response to the fact that others want an education. Likewise, a Syrian man’s status as a trafficker of refugees is possible via his recognition and response to an exile’s need for safe passage across the sea. With these examples we discover that our place in a distinct human community is based on our ability to respond to the wants and needs of others. Yet Levinas shows us that hospitality not only determines our identities in specific communities but is also the mark of humanity — hospitality is the basis of human community as such.

The existence of distinct human communities presupposes our ability to welcome and share our property with others. “To recognize the other,” Levinas wrote in “Totality and Infinity,” “is to come to him across the world of possessed things, but at the same time to establish, by gift, community and universality.” Once our enjoyment of the world has been questioned by another’s need, hospitality establishes human community in the act of giving and with the creation of a common tongue. Language, Levinas wrote in his work,

is universal because it is the very passage from the individual to the general, because it offers things that are mine to the other. To speak is to make the world common, to create commonplaces. Language does not refer to the generality of concepts, but lays the foundations for a possession in common. It abolishes the inalienable property of enjoyment. The world in discourse is no longer what it is in separation, in the being at home with oneself where everything is given to me; it is what I give: the communicable, the thought, the universal.

While the creation of a common tongue is the basis of human community, language also allows us to label others and thus explicitly identify and distinguish our selves from them. This facilitates our tendency to overlook a face in need and see a “Syrian” or “Muslim” that is not like me. The foundation of a human community also raises the question of “other others” whereby any face-to-face encounter may be interrupted by the face of another. We are asked, in other words, to share our possessions with all human beings. Levinas sees this request as an infinite but impossible responsibility, since we could give what we have to anyone, but we do not have enough to give to all. In the face of this impossible responsibility we require justice: the systematic organization and distribution of resources amongst human beings. And from here we are not far from the formation of nation states with rigid identities and physical boundaries and the barbed-wire resistance with which we began.

Although we seem to have come full circle, Levinas has taught us that our responsibility for others is the foundation of all human communities, and that the very possibility of living in a meaningful human world is based on our ability to give what we can to others. And since welcoming and sharing are the foundation upon which all communities are formed, no amount of inhospitable nationalism can be consistently defended when confronted with the suffering of other human beings. “In the relationship between same and other, my welcoming of the other is,” as Levinas puts it, “the ultimate fact.” It is the hospitality of humanity, or a peace prior to all hostility. And in this primary peace, in this basic welcoming of refugees, Levinas reminds us that “things figure not as what one builds but as what one gives.”

One of its board members, Philipp Rösler, explained that the test meant “there would be no opportunity for an international, global dialogue in the spirit of the World Economic Forum.”

But if the World Economic Forum isn’t an opportunity to have an “international, global dialogue” about North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, with its foreign minister in attendance, then what’s the point?

Andrew Ross Sorkin asks in the DealBook column.

Davos has in the past been the stage for meaningful debate and compromise among policy makers. Greece and Turkey signed a no-war agreement there in 1988. Six years later, Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, entered the stage holding hands.

But it seems as if much of the debate is sanitized, Mr. Sorkin writes.

Two years ago, the Ukrainian prime minister, Mykola Azarov, was disinvited after protesters were shot in Kiev. Although WikiLeaks dominated talk at Davos for several years, Julian Assange was never invited.

Until last year, discussions that focused on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people were not on the agenda in part because of objections from certain delegations from the Middle East and Eastern Europe.

But blaming the World Forum for the lack of debate may be misplaced, Mr. Sorkin says. It is the international community’s responsibility to communicate with each other and North Korea is just one challenge in an increasingly complex and dangerous world.

A conference of disparate voices works only if all parties attend, and it may be harder to get them in the same room, especially with tensions reminiscent of the Cold War flaring,

as Liz Alderman reports in DealBook.

Given the strains currently affecting the world, the panels on the official theme of “Mastering the Fourth Industrial Revolution” could prove to be little more than sideshows.

China and its slowing economy may be foremost in in their concerns, although no clear remedies are likely to emerge because no top leaders from China will be present.

There are plenty of sessions on timely topics, including the refugee crisis in Europe and the threat of terrorism, but they are also unlikely to sway national policies. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President François Hollande of France are not attending.

There may still be opportunity for progress on thorny topics, though.

SEATTLE — Microsoft plans to give away $1 billion in cloud services to nonprofits and university researchers over the next three years, as the company updates its philanthropic initiatives to reflect shifts in technology.

The company’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, intends to announce the company’s commitment Tuesday evening in Davos, Switzerland, at the World Economic Forum, the annual meeting of business and political leaders. The plan is intended to make it easier for nonprofits and researchers to gain access to the same cloud computing tools that have enabled business to become more nimble and tackle big technical challenges.

Brad Smith, the company’s president and chief legal officer, said other organizations outside the corporate sector have been slower to adopt cloud services. “It’s important that we enable the nonprofit community to make the transition to the cloud services era,” he said in an interview.

Microsoft’s cloud services include Azure, which allows organizations to host their own websites and online applications in Microsoft’s data centers, as well as Power BI, Dynamics CRM Online and other Microsoft-made applications for running organizations. CRM Online, for instance, is a customer relationship management service that can be useful for nonprofits in accepting financial contributions from individual donors.

Microsoft has been giving away traditional software for years. Mr. Smith estimates the value of those software donations at about $750 million a year and said that they will continue even as Microsoft gives away cloud services.

Microsoft hopes to give away its cloud services to 70,000 nonprofits in the next three years. The company plans to expand by 50 percent an existing program that donates Azure storage and computing resources to university projects. The company will also invest in low-cost Internet access technologies in developing countries.

Philanthropic giveaways from technology companies are sometimes viewed by critics as thinly veiled efforts to make money even if they’re not making direct sales to the recipients of the donations. Facebook‘s effort to provide free Internet access to the developing world through its Internet.org initiative has come under attack from net neutrality activists in India who see it as a way of promoting Facebook services to the detriment of those from rival companies.

Microsoft says it will not take a tax deduction for the donated cloud services.

Mr. Smith said that Microsoft decided against creating an independent foundation for its philanthropic efforts because it believed the effort would have more impact if it was part of the company.

“Our philosophy is that philanthropy, at its best, often combines doing well with doing good,” he said. “One of the defining characteristics of Microsoft in 2016 is the degree to which we’re a mission-driven company. We rely most fundamentally on products and the market to fulfill that mission.”",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/19/microsoft-to-donate-1-billion-in-cloud-services-to-nonprofits-and-researchers/

“It’s not magic, it’s math,” said Mr. Levchin, a co-founder of PayPal.
Affirm’s task is made easier because, while it is a credit card alternative, it is not a general-purpose credit card.
The effectiveness of the new lending math practiced by Affirm and others is one issue.","['mr', 'digital', 'rules', 'lenders', 'loans', 'math', 'card', 'affirms', 'loan', 'affirm', 'purchase', 'borrowers', 'credit']","Photo

Miguel Jimenez, a 20-year-old amateur musician in Appleton, Wis., had his eye on a classic Rickenbacker bass guitar last year. He searched the Internet and found Reverb, an online marketplace for musical instruments, which had the bass guitar he wanted. But the price tag was $1,600.

“It was way more than my credit card ever would have allowed me to spend,” recalled Mr. Jimenez, a sales associate at a local retail store, whose bank credit card has a $500 limit.

Yet that apparent hurdle soon fell away. Reverb offered an alternative, Affirm, a lending start-up that provides installment financing. Mr. Jimenez applied in a few minutes on his smartphone, his purchase was then approved almost instantly, and he got his guitar. He chose a 12-month plan, with monthly payments of $150.

Why would Affirm, a San Francisco start-up, make the seemingly snap judgment that Mr. Jimenez was a solid credit risk for a purchase more than three times the limit on his MasterCard?

“I wouldn’t know,” replied Max Levchin, Affirm’s chief executive. “Our math model says he’s O.K. Probabilistically, he’s good for the money.”

The new wave of digital lending start-ups all say they are bringing the new math of data science to analyzing whether borrowers will pay back their loans. So far, the upstart consumer bankers offer mainly alternatives to credit cards, unsecured personal loans of all kinds, and refinancing of student-loan debt.

The traditional approach to risk-scoring relies on a person’s credit history, as distilled in FICO scores. The newcomers crunch all kinds of additional data including social network profiles, bill payment histories, public records, online communications, even how applicants fill out forms on the web.

It’s a digital-age spin on banking’s basic rule: know your customer. The more detailed, data-driven portrait of borrowers, the start-ups insist, will allow them to offer credit to more consumers at lower costs — and still make a tidy profit. That, they say, is especially true for young people with scant credit histories — the tech-savvy millennials whose money-handling habits are already shaking up the banking industry, as I wrote about this week.

Affirm is one of the most ambitious new lenders, in terms of relying purely on algorithms and automation to make its lending decisions. Many of the other start-ups are very data-driven but people are used to ask applicants follow-up questions or to make the final call on loans.

Not so at Affirm. A person taps in his or her name, cellphone number, birth date and the last four digits of the person’s Social Security number. Affirm sends the applicant a text message of a short string of numbers, which the person types in to authenticate that he or she is the person at that cellphone number. Then, Affirm’s algorithms approve or reject the loan and purchase within seconds.

“It’s not magic, it’s math,” said Mr. Levchin, a co-founder of PayPal.

Affirm’s task is made easier because, while it is a credit card alternative, it is not a general-purpose credit card. Affirm’s installment financing is for the purchase of a particular good at a particular merchant. The more than 100 merchants using Affirm so far are heavily weighted to specialized retailers of home furnishings, clothing, jewelry, exercise equipment, bicycles and musical instruments. Their offerings tend to be pricey. And initially, Affirm has been most used by people in their 20s and 30s.

All that raises the question of whether Affirm’s credit-analyzing models are clever or whether borrowers with certain demographics buying certain goods are simply good bets? To paraphrase Mr. Levchin, It’s not math, it’s the market.

As a start-up, Affirm does not publicly disclose its financial results. But its early performance and prospects have impressed investors. Affirm has raised $325 million in debt and equity financing.

And Affirm’s internal figures indicate its installment loans cost less than credit-card loans. For borrowers with prime credit ratings, Affirm’s interest on a 12-month loan is 8 percent, compared with 16 percent in interest and fees on a credit card loan, according to the company’s analysis.

For subprime borrowers, the Affirm cost is 13 percent, compared with 19 percent for credit cards. For “entry” borrowers with scant credit history, the Affirm rate is 16 percent, compared with 24 percent for credit cards. A separate analysis by Affirm shows that its loan approval rates are also substantially higher across all three groups of borrowers.

The effectiveness of the new lending math practiced by Affirm and others is one issue. But the other issue is fairness. That challenge is underlined in a new report by the Federal Trade Commission, “Big Data: A Tool for Inclusion or Exclusion?” The commission report pointed to the consumer benefits that can flow from the technology, but also addressed concerns that “companies could use big data to exclude low-income and underserved communities from credit and employment opportunities.”

Affirm, for one, acknowledges that fairness has to part of its model. Mr. Levchin is on an advisory committee to the government’s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Affirm’s general counsel is Manuel Alvarez, a former lawyer for the consumer protection bureau. The danger to avoid, Mr. Alvarez said, is “you seem to have a neutral tool, but its impact is not.”",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/19/at-new-digital-lenders-math-rules/

In the six and a half years that Dick Costolo led Twitter’s executive ranks, he helped grow the company from a few hundred employees to a few thousand. Seven months after leaving Twitter, Mr. Costolo is going small again.

On Tuesday, Mr. Costolo said he plans to build a new start-up focused on physical fitness, one of his longtime passions. The former Twitter chief executive said he would work with Bryan Oki, a health and wellness trainer.

In addition, Mr. Costolo said he will join Index Ventures, the venture capital firm based in San Francisco and London. As a venture partner with Index, he will invest in new companies, as well as advise and mentor entrepreneurs and tech executives.

“Having the opportunity to work with the great team at Index while also embarking on my own new venture makes the beginning of 2016 a very special time for me,” Mr. Costolo said. “I can’t wait to dive in.”

The moves is the next chapter for Mr. Costolo, who announced he was stepping down as Twitter’s chief executive last June as user growth at the social networking company stalled. At the time, Mr. Costolo said little about what he would do after Twitter. Since then, he has acted as a consultant for the HBO series “Silicon Valley,” and spent time advising the show’s writers last year.

Mr. Costolo is no stranger to start-ups. He co-founded a handful of them in the 1990s and 2000s, the most noteworthy being Feedburner, which Google acquired in 2007 for a reported $100 million.

Mr. Costolo joined Twitter after Google, becoming chief operating officer before ascending to chief executive in 2010. He was largely credited with building up Twitter from roughly 300 employees to more than 3,000, and took the company public.

When Twitter’s user growth problems brought scrutiny from Wall Street and others, Mr. Costolo found solace in his fitness regimen, which consisted of everything from CrossFit workouts to bike sprints to weight training.

In his new start-up, Mr. Costolo will work with Mr. Oki on a software platform to help motivate people to work out without focusing on one specific type of fitness community — like yoga or SoulCycle, for instance.

“The fitness industry is transitioning to a world of specialized studios and programs with a multitude of connected devices and software trackers,” Mr. Costolo said. “We’ve developed a system that works within this evolving landscape, and we believe we can scale this system with technology and deliver it to a massive audience.”",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/19/dick-costolo-former-twitter-c-e-o-embarks-on-next-chapter/

More important, Ms. Nyamayaro said, she realized that because of all this talk of change, there was no measurement that could serve as a reference point.

Ms. Whitmarsh’s approach has been softer than what some have referred to as a “name and shame” strategy. She has sought to make the case that placing more women in decision-making positions will lead to better performance and financial returns.

“I think the business case has become more substantive,” Ms. Whitmarsh said.

Investments are expected to be diversified, so why is that logic not applied to gender, Ms. Whitmarsh asks in the paper she will release at Davos. Men and women have biological and cognitive differences that mean they approach decisions differently, she posits.

Ms. Nyamayaro is trying a different tack. An aim of the HeForShe movement she heads is to get men to champion and voice their concerns for gender equality. When she began her job at U.N. Women several years ago, Ms. Nyamayaro said, she quickly learned that because men hold most positions of power in business and politics, she needed to find a way to get them engaged in the subject.

More important, Ms. Nyamayaro said, she realized that because of all this talk of change, there was no measurement that could serve as a reference point. In the corporate world, for example, companies have historically been reluctant to disclose details of the gender and racial makeup of their employees.

“When we talk about progress, we have to know what it is we’re measuring,” she said. This week, HeForShe will publish for the first time a report of the gender makeup of 10 global companies, including AccorHotels, Barclays, Twitter, McKinsey & Company, Schneider Electric and Unilever.

The 10 companies will disclose the percentage of women in the top 6 percent of executives, the board of directors and new workers. They have also agreed to engage with their employees on the subject, asking them to come up with solutions internally to increase the ratio of female to male employees. In one encouraging sign, more than half of new members to Barclays’ WIN organization — begun as the Women’s Initiative Network but recently broadened to encourage wider participation — were men in 2015, according to HeForShe.

As part of the campaign, HeForShe is also working directly with the chairmen and chairwomen, chief executives or chief operating officers of each participating company, encouraging them to set goals for gender parity. Paul Polman, the chief executive of Unilever, pledged to reach parity in management by 2020. AccorHotels plans to reach pay parity for its 180,000 employees by 2020, Ms. Nyamayaro says.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/business/dealbook/a-push-for-gender-equality-at-the-world-economic-forum-and-beyond.html

Boards will also hire financial advisers to show that this is all fair to the employees and there was no other choice but to do the down round and reduce the value of the common stock. Expect the financial advisers to always find that this is the case.

Employees Versus New Money

This leads to the second battle. Silicon Valley is a place where failure is held up as a virtue. Employees aren’t going to stick around long if they see their equity stake wiped out. They will move to the next start-up and take their chances there.

The down round is a “lemon” signal to the market that the company’s business plan is not working out. And one of the thorniest issues in dealing with down rounds is how a former unicorn keeps its employees after destroying the value of their shares.

In some cases, the employees will be out of luck and left with nothing. This is more likely to happen if the company is sold at a lower valuation than if it raises money in a down round. But even if the common stock has some value, it is likely to be worth much less and certainly not a billion dollars.

Jawbone, for example, recently did a down round at roughly half its previous $3 billion financing, carving out additional common shares for employees to make up for their loss. Foursquare also did a recent down round and publicly stated it was raised on “employee-friendly” terms, implying a common stock issuance. The preferred shareholders, however, will still have to be paid first for the employees to collect on their new common shares. These actions may end up being more about public relations than an actual payout.

If stock incentives are often no longer an option, since all of the stock worth anything is held by investors in the preferred category, cash bonus plans or other incentive plans that pay cash in the event of a success may be necessary. The problem, of course, is that it just isn’t as good as cold-hard stock with its potential for a big payout. So expect some hard bargaining and companies searching for ways to win back the loyalty of their employees.

These efforts are likely to fail. No one likes to be told that, after winning the lottery, they have to give up the money. And so, it is no surprise that some companies do not survive down rounds, not because of finances, but because they can no longer keep their employees.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/business/dealbook/expect-some-unicorns-to-lose-their-horns-and-it-wont-be-pretty.html

Such investment in Asia jumped from just $2.8 billion in the first quarter of 2014 to $14.2 billion in the third quarter of 2015.

Just last week China announced a $30 billion fund to help bail out struggling electronics makers and other tech firms, a potential indication that the recent slowdown and stock market turmoil could spill over into the strategically important tech sector.

The Chinese trend follows a broader pullback in global venture capital investment at the end of 2015. In the United States, deals fell for the second straight quarter to their lowest level since 2011, according to the report. In the last quarter of the year, the total amount of money funding private companies fell by 30 percent from the previous quarter.

Yet the drop-off in China and Asia comes amid a very different context than the drop-off in the United States. In Asia, the increase in venture capital funding rose much more sharply after 2013. Such investment in Asia jumped from just $2.8 billion in the first quarter of 2014 to $14.2 billion in the third quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter it fell to $9.7 billion.

Still, 2015 was a banner year for Asian venture capital investment, with deals totaling $39.7 billion in 2015, well above the $21.1 billion in 2014 and the meager $6.4 billion in 2013.

The report said venture capital firms may be sitting out the latest investment rounds because they expect valuations to come back down to earth in the next year or two. In Asia, roughly one-third of investment in start-ups comes from large corporations, compared to just a quarter in North America.

Lyndon Fung, an analyst with KPMG’s U.S. capital markets group, wrote in the report that Chinese investors are also increasingly looking abroad.

EXPECT SOME UNICORNS TO LOSE THEIR HORNS | With the market forcing highfliers among tech start-ups to seek money at lower valuations, you can expect a bloodbath as employers, founders and investors clash,

Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in the Deal Professor. The biggest battle at unicorns, or start-ups with a valuation of $1 billion or more, will be between the common and preferred shareholders.

Employees and founders often hold common shares that sit below the preferred shares held by venture capitalists, which have protections not given to common shareholders. Liquidation preferences mean preferred shareholders receive a minimum payment if the company is sold. Anti-dilution rights provide that when new money comes in at a lower valuation — a so-called down round — investors from prior rounds get compensated. A down round hits employees and founders hard.

Directors on the board of a unicorn will have to be careful to avoid a lawsuit. The second battle will be the fight to retain employees. One of the thorniest issues in dealing with down rounds is how a former unicorn keeps its employees after destroying the value of their shares. If stock incentives are no longer an option, cash bonus plans or other incentive plans that pay cash in the event of a success may be necessary. But that just isn’t as good as stock with a potential for a big payout, so expect some hard bargaining. These efforts are likely to fail, Mr. Solomon says. Some companies do not survive down rounds, not because of finances but because they cannot keep their employees. There will also be battles between new and old money as preferred-stock holders duke it out with new down-round investors. The old money may rely on their protections as preferred shareholders, but a desperate company may try to seize control. The new money could also insist on super-contractual protections, like more aggressive anti-dilution rights and higher liquidation preferences. There might also be fights between the founders and everyone else. The new money could be in a position to decide whether to keep the founders, who will have to work harder and own a smaller stake if they stay.

LEGISLATION COULD ADD TO SCRUTINY OF REGULATORS | Congressional efforts to scrutinize the regulators that write the rules for Wall Street are gaining momentum, potentially creating more obstacles to closer financial oversight, Victoria Finkle reports in DealBook. A bipartisan group of senators is working on a package of regulatory reform bills that is likely to include a measure to subject the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other independent agencies to a heightened cost-benefit analysis and review process, people briefed on the plans said. Supporters say the legislation would provide more consistency and transparency in the rule-making process. Critics warn that it is intended to create additional burdens and delays, while making rules more vulnerable to legal challenges. The Senate group needs at least two more Democrats to support the legislation to avoid having the package blocked on the floor. The measures could be introduced in the coming weeks. Other proposals are being considered as part of the Senate effort, including measures to establish a nine-person commission to review duplicative and outdated rules already on the books, and a requirement that regulators publish advance notices for all major rule-makings.

ON THE AGENDA | The Bureau for Labor Statistics will release the Consumer Price Index for December at 8:30 a.m. Goldman Sachs will release its fourth-quarter results at about 7:30 a.m; a conference call will follow at 9:30 a.m. The Bank of Canada will publish its decision on interest rates and monetary policy at 10 a.m.",https://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/morning-agenda-oil-market-tests-banks/

The number of Chinese students competing to enter high schools and colleges in the United States has soared in recent years. According to the Institute of International Education, in the 2014-15 academic year, more than 300,000 Chinese were enrolled in American higher education, almost triple the number five years before.

Traditionally, colleges conduct on-campus interviews or enlist alumni to help. But with the surge in applications from China, colleges are unable to keep up with the volume of interview requests. To sift through the flood of applicants, more American institutions have sought third-party interviews with prospective students. This helps determine whether students who score high on paper can also engage in class discussions. It also provides a check against fraud, such as forged transcripts or application essays ghostwritten by hired agents, by testing their English-language abilities.

That in turn has given rise to new services on the Chinese side to meet that demand. Terry Crawford, the chief executive of InitialView, which provides interview services and was founded in Beijing in 2009, said that in 2013, more than 6,000 applications from China included an InitialView interview and that by 2014, the number exceeded 17,000. According to Chinese admissions agents, more than a third of the 100 top-rated American colleges and universities recommend third-party interviews, though few require them.

Jiang Xiaobo, the director of the college counseling center at the Beijing National Day School, said, “Third-party interviews require a high level of communication skills in English and logical thinking, which poses a challenge to students who grew up in the traditional education system in China.” That system tends to emphasize written test results, with little regard for extracurricular pursuits.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/world/asia/china-us-college-application.html

Last year, Chinese exports fell for the first time since the financial crisis — and for only the second time since the country’s economy began reopening to the outside world in the late 1970s.

That position is likely to be further eroded by the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The United States-led trade agreement deepens American ties with Asian countries like Vietnam and Malaysia, but it excludes China.

The slump has created a tricky situation for the government.

Officials have encouraged phasing out low-end exports in favor of promoting the service sector and high-tech manufacturing. While newer and more dynamic companies are on the rise in China, the risk is that they won’t develop fast enough to offset the hollowing out of light manufacturing, which remains a shrinking but significant employer across the country.

Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey has been softening his past record on gun controls with each visit to gun friendly states as he vies for the Republican presidential nomination. As rival candidates on the gun lobby’s A-list questioned his devotion to the cause, Mr. Christie reversed his previous support for an assault weapons ban — a position he strongly voiced in his earliest days of politicking for New Jersey office. In another reversal, he vetoed a ban that would have kept the controversial, armor-piercing .50-caliber rifle out of the hands of civilians.

And now, as the Iowa caucus approaches, Governor Christie has pocket-vetoed a measure approved by the state legislature designed to encourage the development of so-called “smart” handguns equipped with technologies that allow a weapon to be fired only by the owner. This is an approach long awaited by gun safety proponents and strongly endorsed earlier this month by President Obama. Smart guns use electronic and fingerprint controls to head off tragedies in which children and other non-owners are able to shoot unsecured weapons.

The governor declined to sign the smart gun measure into law this week within the required period without offering a reason why; his office criticized the closing legislative process as too rushed. Another measure Governor Christie pocket vetoed would have added convicted gang members and those found making terrorist threats to the state list of people denied guns.

In the past, Mr. Christie has questioned whether smart gun technology is even feasible. But a German company developed a model that shops in California and Maryland sought to market two years ago until they faced protests and threats of death and arson, according to The Washington Post. Gun rights advocates, including the National Rifle Association, say they are not opposed to smart gun technology but fear the government would use it to displace conventional weapons.

In 2002, New Jersey enacted a law requiring stores to sell only smart guns three years after the technology entered the marketplace. But the law backfired as opponents used it as a cause to squelch the guns’ development. The corrective legislation that Mr. Christie vetoed would have erased that law and allowed the sale of traditional firearms alongside smart guns.

Are your students “Star Wars” fanatics? Are you?

Not only has the new movie “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” shattered box-office records, it has also carried the franchise even deeper into popular culture, from the catwalk to the presidential campaigns. The force is strong.

If you are looking for ways to bring “Star Wars” into your classroom using some of the thousands of articles The Times has published since the first movie debuted in 1977, we offer teaching ideas for subjects across the curriculum — from analyzing Yoda’s syntax to investigating the economic consequences of destroying the Death Star.

Is “Star Wars” a part of your classroom? Tell us how you teach it.

ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS: Tackle Shakespeare With Yoda, You Will

Photo

Yoda used a very recognizable and unique sentence structure when he communicated his wisdom. Standard English sentences typically follow a subject-verb-object order, but Yoda tended to use an object-subject-verb structure. Here are some examples:

“Much to learn, you still have.”

“Hard to see, the dark side is.”

“Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is.”

For starters, students can analyze Yoda’s speech patterns on their own to see if they can discern any consistent rules. There are quote lists all over the web.

But, Yoda’s speech can serve as more than just a grammatical novelty in English classrooms. It can aid students in tackling the challenging syntax commonly found in both poetry and Shakespeare’s plays. If they can comprehend Yoda’s wisdom, they will be on their way to making sense of “King Lear.”

In Ethan Gilsdorf’s review of Ian Doescher’s book “William Shakespeare’s Tragedy of the Sith’s Revenge,” one installment in a series of best-selling “Star Wars”/Shakespeare mash-ups, he writes:

In “The Empire Strikes Back,” Yoda admonishes his apprentice, Luke Skywalker, saying, “Wars not make one great.” Later, in “Return of the Jedi,” he quips, “When 900 years old you reach, look as good you will not.” In case you didn’t catch on, Yoda inverts his syntax. In other words, Yoda practically speaks Shakespearean.

In fact, in Mr. Doescher’s series, every character, from Wookiees to droids, speaks Shakespearean.

Taking inspiration from Yoda and Mr. Doescher’s mash-ups, students can try “Shakespearifying” scenes from the “Star Wars” franchise — or from other popular films or TV shows.

HISTORY: Finding Echoes of the Past in Fiction

In “Studying How ‘Star Wars’ Mined History,” Noam Cohen writes:

The events in “Star Wars,” the opening credits reveal, happened “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.” But did similar events happen before? That is the question posed by “Star Wars and History.”

This book, written with the cooperation of George Lucas, is intended to “give fans an inside look at the real science, history and political science that informed ‘Star Wars.’ ” The historical influences span from Nazi Germany to Richard Nixon to the Roman Empire.

But, even without knowing or trying to guess Mr. Lucas’s inspiration, students can apply their knowledge of history to make connections between the fictional universe in “Star Wars” and actual past events.

When has a small army of rebels taken on a massive empire? Where have humans and other sentient beings been held in slavery? When have individuals made the choice to be bystanders, perpetrators or rescuers? What other echoes of world history do you see in the “Star Wars” saga? How?

SCIENCE: The Physics of Space Battles

Are explosions just a waste of energy in space? Would warships be sleek and snazzy, or would they just be spherical? These are some of the questions that Joseph Shoer ponders in his 2009 essay on the technology site Gizmodo.

In “The Physics of Space Battles,” The Times writes about the essay:

Shoer, a Ph.D. candidate in aerospace engineering, says any real space battles would likely have — yawn — “relatively long periods during which Newtonian physics govern the motions of dogfighting spacecraft, punctuated by relatively short periods of maneuvering.” That’s because spacecraft typically are sharply curtailed by the realities of propulsion and orbit dynamics – “not just of their own ships in orbit around planets and suns, but those planets’ orbits.”

Of course, special effects in movies are designed to be dramatic. But to what extent do they defy physics?

Have students watch almost any battle scene in “Star Wars” and consider: Are the laws of physics being bent or ignored? How might reality differ from the fantasy depicted?

Students can repeat the same activity with other fantasy films or video games as well.

MATH: Creating Fractal Islands

The “Star Wars” series brings to life a fictional galaxy that continually expands in complexity as new lands are revealed in an evolving story line.

Students can imagine themselves as cartographers contributing to an atlas that maps the planets in the “Star Wars” universe. The site Star Wars in the Classroom includes a lesson plan (PDF) outlining a creative geography unit that guides students through doing just that.

To incorporate math into this activity, students can generate fractal islands to represent a planet’s continents — a hands-on activity adapted from Dr. Chartier’s book “Math Bytes: Google Bombs, Chocolate-Covered Pi, and Other Cool Bits in Computing.”

Students can make these continents by hand using a pencil, paper and two dice. (We will assume one die is red and the other blue, although you could just roll twice.)

To start, begin with a square. It’s endpoints are at (0,0), (0,16), (16,0) and (16,16). Now, follow these steps, for each of the four line segments:

Roll the dice. If the red die equals 1 to 3, you’ll move the line’s midpoint by 2 units. If the blue die equals 1-3, you’ll move in the positive direction, else the negative. If the red die equals 4 to 6, you’ll move the line’s midpoint by 4 units. If the blue die equals 1-3, you’ll move in the positive direction, else the negative.

Repeat this step, but now moving the y-value of your new point.

Here are different shapes generated by this activity:

Photo

Photo

Can’t imagine these shapes appearing as masses of land on distant planets? To add sophistication to the end product, students can use a computer.

Rather than moving points by 2 or 4, students can pick a random value between -7/10 and 7/10. Given they are using a computer, they can repeat the step, but now let the midpoint of each line segment vary by a random amount chosen from an interval half the size of the last step’s interval. They can do this as many times as they like, although eventually, they’ll see very little visual difference between iterates. Students can try this process with this applet.

As they iterate, students are creating a fractal island — or a newly revealed continent on a distant planet in a galaxy far, far away.

ECONOMICS: The Death Star, Too Big to Fail?

Photo

Ever think about the economy of “Star Wars”? Not the nominal versus inflation-adjusted performance of the latest “Star Wars” film, though that’s interesting too. But, the actual economy of the Old Republic, the Galactic Empire and the entire “Star Wars” galaxy?

In the article “In ‘Star Wars,’ Was the Death Star Too Big to Fail?”, Zachary Feinstein writes:

At the end of “Star Wars: Episode VI — Return of the Jedi,” the heroic Rebel Alliance defeats the evil Galactic Empire, destroying the second Death Star, the empire’s central space station (and superweapon). Audiences typically respond to the destruction of the Death Star with triumphant cheers. But over the years, a number of perhaps more reflective fans have paused to question the consequences of this event. In his movie “Clerks,” for example, the writer and director Kevin Smith has his protagonists debate the ethics of destroying the second Death Star, whose construction was still underway, given the collateral damage to the contractors (“plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers”) building it. As a financial engineer, I have another concern: the economic repercussions for the “Star Wars” galaxy. In a recent working paper, I brought the analysis of financial systemic risk to bear on this question. I found that the resulting financial crisis would cause a serious galactic depression of astronomical proportions — so large, in fact, that it suggests the rebel victory might have been a pyrrhic one.

Students can read through Dr. Feinstein’s economic analysis and offer their critique. Do they accept his assumptions? Does his conclusion make sense? And, does his “Star Wars” investigation help to make the case for continuing to study how to model financial contagion and measure systemic risk?

ART: Take a Selfie, Create a New “Star Wars” Character

Photo

Students might be surprised to learn that the character Yoda was essentially modeled after its creator’s own face.

Monte Reel writes in “Stuart Freeborn: The Makeup Artist Who Became Yoda,”

Stuart Freeborn built his reputation by staring deep into the faces of others, defining their best features and digging into his makeup kit to make sure everyone else noticed them, too. He learned how to accentuate a cheekbone from none other than Marlene Dietrich. The arch in Vivien Leigh’s eyebrow owed some of its impish charm to him. But decades into his career, when George Lucas asked him to create a centuries-old Jedi master, Freeborn took a long look at a face that he had never considered with much professional interest: His own. The character of Yoda would become a fun-house distortion of Freeborn’s own reflection.

The article continues:

In the mirror, Freeborn could examine the contours of the crown of his skull, fully exposed by a hairline that completed a retreat years before. Freeborn etched deep wrinkles into Yoda’s bald scalp that were exaggerated replicas of the lines that creased his own forehead when, for example, he zeroed in on the tight-focus particulars of Yoda’s physiognomy. The pointed chin, the compact nose and the thin, pursed lips all made the leap from the mirror to the model. The only feature he borrowed from someone else was the upper lip: It was a hairless version of Albert Einstein’s, Freeborn said. He hoped that it might trigger a subconscious association and that viewers might intuit Yoda’s extraordinary intelligence.

Inspired by Mr. Freeborn’s creation, students can design their own “fun-house distortion” of their reflection or selfie. Together, the class can assemble a new cast of characters for the not-yet-released “Star Wars” films.

JOURNALISM: “Star Wars” in The New York Times

Last year on May 4, or “Star Wars Day,” The Learning Network, with help from the @NYTarchives Twitter account, rounded up early Times reporting on the films, the fans and the meaning of “Star Wars” in our culture.

As we suggested then, try searching “Star Wars” in The Times and you’ll come up with all kinds of interesting things — from thoughtful personal essays to videos of “Star Wars”-themed pranks. Use them as models for your own essays or reviews, or as inspiration for other “Star Wars”-themed journalism projects for your school or community newspaper.

Here are but a few. What can you find?

He does not forecast that technological progress will slow to a crawl.
Professor Gordon’s view of slowing technological opportunities meshes with other bits of evidence.
But it also suggests that investors, whether they realize it or not, may agree with Professor Gordon’s proposition.

Nonetheless, Professor Gordon’s argument is not easy to dismiss. He does not forecast that technological progress will slow to a crawl. His argument, rather, is that the explosion of innovation and prosperity from 1920 through 1970 was a one-time phenomenon. From now on, progress will continue at the more gradual pace of both the last 40 years and the period before 1920.

“There is plenty of room in my forecast for evolutionary change,” he told me. “What is lacking is sharp, discrete change.”

He is not the only economist forecasting slower progress, now that the burst of productivity gains of the late 1990s and early 2000s has waned. “Growth in educational attainment, developed-economy R&D intensity and population are all likely to be slower in the future than in the past,” John G. Fernald of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and Charles I. Jones of Stanford wrote in a recent article.

Professor Gordon’s view of slowing technological opportunities meshes with other bits of evidence.

Ben S. Bernanke, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve who is now at the Brookings Institution, points out that long-term interest rates have been declining for a very long time. This is in response partly to the accumulation of savings in China and other developing economies, which have been buying Treasury bonds hand over fist. But it also suggests that investors, whether they realize it or not, may agree with Professor Gordon’s proposition.

“People who invest money in the markets are saying the rate of return on capital investments is lower than it was 15 or 30 years ago,” Mr. Bernanke said. “Gordon’s forecast is not without some market reality.”

Other strands of data point in this direction. Business dynamism, measured by the role of new companies in the economy, appears to be waning. The share of employment in companies less than five years old dropped from about 19 percent in 1982 to 11 percent in 2011.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/business/economy/a-somber-view-of-americas-pace-of-progress.html

Investor concerns over growth in China and oil prices drove global markets lower on Wednesday, pushing London and Japan into a bear market.

Asian markets seemed to reflect few of these worries on Thursday morning, but the calm did not last past lunchtime. The Nikkei 225-share index, which had closed down 3.7 percent on Wednesday, lost 2.4 percent Thursday. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong reversed the 1.5 percent it had gained in the morning to close 1.8 percent lower.

Markets in mainland China were nervous throughout the day. They opened lower and the main Shanghai index was down 3.2 percent at the close, while Shenzhen shares finished down 4 percent.

In the unsettling movements on Wednesday, the Euro Stoxx 50 closed down 3.3 percent. Although stocks in the United States plunged during the day, they pared losses later. The Dow closed down 1.6 percent, while the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 1.2 percent. This led some analysts to suggest that financial markets might be overreacting and that the moves might not reflect the strength of the global economy, as Peter Eavis and Neil Gough report in DealBook.

In fact, if you look at financial markets, you would think the world was falling apart, Neil Irwin writes in The Upshot. But things look reasonably solid — the International Monetary Fund projected global growth of 3.4 percent this year.

The falling prices are unnerving because it is hard to tell a simple story about what is driving them, Mr. Irwin says. The markets could be moving according to their own internal logic, but they could be pricing in a darker outlook that economists don’t fully understand.

Even Olivier Blanchard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who was chief economist at the I.M.F. until recently, described the market swings as “puzzling.”

Financial markets are always more volatile than the underlying economy. The stock market has predicted nine of the last five recessions, as an old line credited to the economist Paul Samuelson has it.

The challenge for investors is to determine how rational the fear is and we probably won’t know the answer anytime soon, Mr. Irwin says.",https://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/morning-agenda-asia-markets-succumb-to-jitters/

Justin K. Beyer, a partner at Seyfarth Shaw who focuses on trade secrets, said scientists often possessed valuable information about a drug company’s business.

Much of this information, prosecutors said, “would be especially useful for a start-up biopharmaceutical company.”

There appeared to be a power struggle among the defendants as they tried to sort out control of the new company. Tao Li, one of the owners of Renopharma, was accused of raising money for the company from sources including private investors and government agencies and universities, according to the indictment. Mr. Mei, the husband of Ms. Xi, worked in China to market and sell the information, prosecutors said.

At one point, Ms. Xi exchanged messages with Mr. Mei, complaining that Ms. Xue had been “annoying” her, but Mr. Mei warned his wife not to lose her temper. She replied, “I won’t ... she is the queen,” according to the indictment.

And it prompted Ms. Xue to warn her colleagues not to ship out more Glaxo documents.

In a statement on Wednesday, Glaxo said it had been cooperating with federal authorities and “we do not believe the breach has had any material impact” on the company’s business or research and development activity. A spokeswoman said the company has one such antibody in early stages of development.

Justin K. Beyer, a partner at Seyfarth Shaw who focuses on trade secrets, said scientists often possessed valuable information about a drug company’s business. “There is a lot of information that a company would want to protect that someone in a scientist role or a business role may have access to,” he said. “It could give them a jump-start in the marketplace.”

However, he added: “These cases tend to rise and fall on what was being done to protect the information and does the information truly represent a trade secret.”

In 2013, after federal prosecutors indicted the two scientists at Eli Lilly, the case disintegrated and the charges were later dropped. And last fall, federal prosecutors dropped all charges against another Chinese-American scientist, Xi Xiaoxing, the chairman of Temple University’s physics department.

The premiere is, of course, about sex, but even this clickbait-ish episode has ambitions. Its segments feature a dominant-submissive couple who conduct their relationship via the Internet and tracking technology; a female victim of an ex-boyfriend, who posted intimate photos of her; and a Japanese man who is in love with an animated character named Rinko. There is a voyeuristic element to this, as there always is when documentarians take up online sex, but there is also a tentative exploration of the possibility that standard ideas about love are headed for a radical expansion.

As a documentary filmmaker, I had often faced the challenge of having to build a visual recreation of an event from the past. And so I began to experiment: Could I use virtual reality to offer a better understanding of how events transpired, and to make people connect to stories they might otherwise ignore? Could I reach younger audiences who are accustomed to digital worlds and gaming platforms, and help them become informed global citizens? To me, these are the ultimate goals of journalism.

I dedicated the next seven years of my life to finding out, using sound as a foundation for storytelling. With my film “Hunger in Los Angeles,” the first V.R. documentary shown at the Sundance Film Festival, in 2012, I used real audio from a food bank where a man waiting in the long line collapsed into a diabetic coma before he received food. At the premiere, I watched with amazement as my audience tried to walk around the “seizure victim” on the ground, while many emerged from the goggles crying.

I pushed further with “Use of Force,” using cellphone video to recreate a scene in which United States Border Patrol officers beat and Tasered a migrant to death. I brought a witness to a lab, where I motion-captured her bodily and facial movements while she recalled her memories of the night. Rather than watching a video of her telling you what happened, you hear and see her own re-creation through her body as much as her words. The story is visceral.

I kept experimenting with what this remarkable medium can do, concentrating on the kind of socially consequential topics that are sometimes difficult to keep an audience focused on with traditional journalism techniques. With “Project Syria,” you stand inside a thoroughly researched re-creation of a street in Aleppo as a bomb goes off. The segment is based on video and audio captured before and after the real event, photographs of the location and Google Earth maps. In “One Dark Night,” about the shooting of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, you see only the events that were documented by 911 calls, within a simulation based on architectural plans of the condominium complex and Mr. Zimmerman’s videotaped police testimony.

We were able to push even further with “Kiya,” a tragic story of a domestic violence homicide that you see here. In this film, two sisters try to save a third sister from being shot by her former boyfriend. It uses Freedom of Information Act material gathered after the homicide; interviews with the sisters and the police; and most important, recordings of two 911 calls that captured the entire sequence of events to re-enact a tragedy and bring new attention to the issue of domestic violence.

I have now seen tens of thousands of people respond to these pieces, and I know that they work. They tell important stories in an entirely new way, and they use the immersive power of virtual reality — its ability to generate intense empathy on the part of the viewer — to wring from the audience the intense emotional connection that these stories deserve. Kiya’s story still haunts me, and I hope that you are moved by it, too.

Tashfeen Malik, one of the attackers, was granted entry to the United States under a K-1 visa, also known as a fiancé visa. Her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, was an American-born citizen. Both died in a shootout with the police.

The attack is believed to have been inspired by the Islamic State terrorist group. Lawmakers fear that terrorists could exploit weaknesses in the visa program, including the program’s inability to accurately track people who overstay, to carry out attacks on American soil.

The report, which lawmakers have been demanding for nearly 20 years, shows that the number of overstays — about a half-million in all — was slightly higher for citizens of countries where a visa is required to visit the United States than for those from countries like France and Germany who are exempt under a visa-waiver program. About 38 countries, mostly in Europe, participate in the visa-waiver program, which allows their citizens to visit the United States without a visa on trips of 90 days or less.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/us/few-foreign-visitors-to-us-overstay-visa-federal-report-says.html

A. Facebook began officially allowing animated GIF files to appear in Timeline updates last year, but there is a specific method for posting them to your page. Instead of uploading them directly as you would a photo or video, you must instead post a link to the animated GIF from its current location on the web. Facebook, which also lets businesses boost promotional posts with animated GIF files, recommends that the files be less than 8 megabytes in size. The site converts animated GIF files uploaded directly to its pages to static images.

As for finding links to animated GIFs, the web has several archives of the looping files, including those at Giphy.com, Imgflip.com and Imgur.com; the Labs area of the Giphy site also hosts extensions for popular browsers and other tools for using animated GIF files. Other sites, like the Digital Public Library of America, collect animated GIFs made from historical images. If you want to use original material for your creation, most animated GIF sites include tools for you to upload content and make your own gently moving pictures.

Once you post the link to your animated GIF, your Facebook friends should see it behave according to their own settings for video playback. If the Auto-play Videos setting is enabled, the GIF should play on its own.

Parker, a business professor at Tulane University and the co-author of “Platform Revolution,” a forthcoming book that explains some of the reasons these businesses may continue their dominance. “These five rode that perfect wave of technological change — an incredible decrease in the cost of I.T., much more network connectivity and the rise of mobile phones. Those three things came together, and there they were, perfectly poised to grow and take advantage of the change.”

Mr. Parker notes the Big Five’s power does not necessarily prevent newer tech companies from becoming huge.

In tech jargon, they own many of the world’s most valuable “platforms” — the basic building blocks on which every other business, even would-be competitors, depend.

‘The Discovery of King Tut’ (Through May 1) The Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamen died when he was only a teenager, but the magnificent riches of his tomb have made him immortal in the public imagination. This touring show at Premier Exhibitions 5th Avenue recreates Tut’s tomb as it was when the British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered it in 1922. The display includes reconstructions of the tomb’s three chambers and reproductions of more than 1,000 treasures and ritual objects, accompanied by video documentaries and texts. 417 Fifth Avenue, at 38th Street, tutnyc.com.

EcoCruises: ‘Winter Seals and Waterbirds of New York Harbor’ (Sunday) A lot of tourists visit New York in the winter, but some of the most interesting won’t be found in the crowds at Times Square. These two-hour cruises from New York City Audubon focus on birds that migrate to this region at this time of year, like many ducks and geese. They also visit the harbor seals that can be found around Governors, Hoffman and Swinburne Islands. (Seal behavior researchers will take part in several of the tours.) An Audubon naturalist narrates the adventures, which include complimentary hot tea and cocoa and are conducted via New York Water Taxi. Warm clothing and binoculars are recommended, as is advance purchase. (Through March 13.) Sundays at noon (except for Feb. 7), Pier 16, South Street Seaport, 89 South Street, near Fulton Street, Lower Manhattan, 212-742-1969, nywatertaxi.com/tours/audubon-winter.

‘Evergreen Express’ (Friday through Sunday) There’s a lot of locomotion going on in the Everett Children’s Adventure Garden at the New York Botanical Garden, and it’s all centered on trees. In this celebration, ending this weekend, children can investigate trails in search of evergreen trees and shrubs. At the Discovery Center Depot, they can investigate evergreen plant parts, make pressings of a conifer specimen and create a miniature pine sachet. Other activities include making an evergreen puppet, patterned after the work of the master artisan Ralph Lee, and putting on puppet shows in the Woodland Theater. Bronx River Parkway (Exit 7W) and Fordham Road, the Bronx, 718-817-8700, nybg.org. Full schedule is on the website.

‘Fashion Academy, the Musical’ (Saturday and Sunday) Vital Theater Company has just revived this show, which focuses on a middle-schooler, MacKenzie Williams, known as Mickey. When her colorful and completely original style doesn’t go over well at her new school, Fashion Academy of Brooklyn, she decides to make over not only her wardrobe, but also herself. Based on the book “Fashion Academy,” by the mother-daughter team of Sheryl Berk and Carrie Berk, this adaptation, by the elder Ms. Berk and Sabrina Chap, asks whether Mickey’s new persona, Kenzie, is really worth the sacrifice. (Through Feb. 28.) At 3:30 p.m., Theater at Blessed Sacrament, 152 West 71st Street, Manhattan, 212-579-0528, vitaltheatre.org.

‘Flight School the Musical’ (Saturday and Sunday) If you want to fly, and you’re a bird, you should be all set, right? Well, not if you happen to be a penguin. That’s the challenge confronting the little hero of this musical revival from Vital Theater Company, recommended for ages 2 through 7 and adapted from “Flight School,” a picture book by Lita Judge. With a script by Cara Lustik, lyrics by Joshua H. Cohen and a score by David Mallamud, this charming show — the score is particularly impressive — chronicles Penguin’s determination to remove the technical obstacles between him and the sky.

Its highlight is a series of drawings and photographs by Frederick Kiesler, the Austrian-American polymath whose Endless House — never completed — fused fine art, architecture, furniture and lighting design into a bulbous, unstable whole. Several artists here echo Kiesler’s theme of the house as a reflection of the psychology of its inhabitants. None is more powerful than Rachel Whiteread’s sober image, made with white correction fluid, of a dwelling in East London: a preparatory drawing for a now lost sculpture crafted by filling the house with liquid concrete. 212-708-9400, moma.org.

★ Museum of Modern Art: ‘Joaquín Torres-García: The Arcadian Modern’ (through Feb. 15) Few artists can claim to have captured a revolution in thinking in a single image, but Joaquín Torres-García did. In 1934, Torres-Garcia (1874-1949) took a hard-won knowledge of European modernism from Paris back to his birthplace of Uruguay. He gave the transplanted movement a name — “The School of the South” — and designed for it a now-famous logo: the silhouette of the South American continent turned upside down and placed above the Tropic of Cancer, where North America was on conventional maps. And he explained the meaning: The South, as a font of creative energy, was the new North, or at least its equal. The image, and the spirit that produced it, can be found in MoMA’s career survey, the artist’s first major United States retrospective in four decades. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)

The title refers to the infinite image blank called the Internet, and borrowed and manipulated images. So built-in delays in accessibility. Almost wherever you look you need to look twice, and consult a label, to fully understand what you’re seeing. The extra effort feels more fruitful in some cases than in others, with work by Yuki Kimura, Basim Magdy, Indre Serpytyte and Lieko Shiga particular worth lingering over. 212-708-9400, moma.org.

On Friday, Christie’s is offering the first major New York auction of self-taught art in many a year, calling it “Liberation Through Expression: Outsider and Vernacular Art.” It includes works by many of the most revered names in the field, including Bill Traylor, Martín Ramírez, William Hawkins and James Castle. And on Thursday, the Outsider Art Fair opened in the Metropolitan Pavilion on West 18th Street, a gathering of 64 dealers, including folk and vernacular art.

Is outsider art going mainstream, as some observers think — and as many others believe it should? Certainly it’s been receiving a lot of attention in recent years. The Massimiliano Gioni’s inclusion of outsider art in the 2013 Venice Biennale was widely read as an indicator of the category’s rise in prestige, an evolution that’s been going on since the early 20th century, when artists like Max Ernst took an interest.

The persistence of the Outsider Art Fair, in its 24th year, reflects a certain paradox that has defined the field. On the one hand, it’s based on artists who are not only self-taught but also wired differently than most people and, in their creative expressions, are freer of certain social expectations and inhibitions than conventionally trained professionals. On the other hand, some advocates think outsider art should be judged more by the aesthetic qualities of the work than by the biography and supposed psychic makeup of the artist. If this latter, formalist view were to prevail, then the field of utsider art would dissolve into the mainstream, becoming just another dimension of modern art history.

For now, while it is better organized and curated than ever, the fair retains its original identity and its considerable appeal as a showcase for offbeat, sometimes hair-raisingly weird art. Great, previously undiscovered outsiders don’t come along very often, so there is not as much turnover as there is in contemporary art fairs. This year, as every year, works by perennials like Henry Darger are in many booths. But viewers also are bound to happen upon wonderful works by artists not so well known.

The combined company would rank as the country’s second-largest broadband provider behind Comcast with about 19.4 million subscribers, and the country’s No. 3 video provider with 17.3 million customers, across about 40 states. That increased heft is coming under close scrutiny as federal regulators continue their review of the Charter deals. If approved, the merger would most likely include strong conditions meant to prevent Charter from leveraging its market power to hurt rival streaming services, regulatory experts said. With increased clout, for instance, the company could restrict television networks from selling their content through stand-alone streaming services.

Charter, which already has announced a number of commitments related to the merger, has extra incentive to agree to conditions. Time Warner Cable would receive a breakup fee of up to $2 billion if the transaction falls apart. The company received nothing when Comcast walked away from its deal.

Another prominent issue is the role and influence of John C. Malone, the media mogul whose company Liberty Broadband would hold a 20 percent stake in a reconstituted Charter. Some groups have called for regulators to place restrictions on the involvement of Mr. Malone, saying that his interests in entertainment companies — including Discovery Communications and Starz — could represent untenable conflicts. Whit Clay, a spokesman for the Liberty businesses, declined to comment.

Charter has argued that its deals pose no threat to the online video market because the future of its business depends more on broadband than its legacy video business. Alex Dudley, a Charter spokesman, said in a statement that the company is committed to creating American jobs, offering innovative products, faster Internet speeds, preserving an open Internet and online video with no data caps or modem fees.

ROME — For nearly 600 years, Lorenzo Ghiberti’s panels depicting scenes from the life of Christ on the north doors of the Baptistery in Florence were exposed to the elements and other vicissitudes of time.

Now, the gilded bronze doors with their 28 panels have been replaced with replicas made by a team of artisans using the materials and techniques mastered centuries ago by the Renaissance sculptor and his workshop.

The replicas of the doors, which together weigh nearly 20,000 pounds, were installed last week and will be officially unveiled at the Baptistery on Saturday.

The new doors are “all handmade, all hand-chiseled, all hand-worked. It took 350 hours for each panel,” said Enrico Marinelli, the president of the Guild of the Dome, a group of private sponsors who paid for the replicas at a cost of 150,000 euros, or about $162,500, per panel. The doors were cast in the foundry of the Frilli Gallery, which Mr. Marinelli owns.

He said the workers experienced the same challenges as Ghiberti had in working with bronze.

“The only advantage we had was electricity,” Mr. Marinelli said, “so we could turn on the oven and know with certainty that the bronze would melt.”

As molds for Ghiberti’s original panels were not available, models were made using the lost-wax casting technique and 3D technology. A video on the guild’s website shows the processes.

At the same time that the team was making the replicas, experts from the Opificio delle Pietre Dure in Florence, the city’s research and restoration institute, were restoring Ghiberti’s original doors, which he fashioned from 1402 to 1424. They are now on permanent exhibit in the museum of the Opera del Duomo.

The restoration revealed detailing that had long been lost under layers of soot, like a frieze of plants and animals, as well as minute features of the biblical figures. Sections of the original gilding also re-emerged.

Ghiberti’s second set of portals for the Baptistery, the so-called Doors of Paradise, made between 1425 and 1452, were put in the museum several years ago after a lengthy restoration.

It also included some cuts in that agenda, including an afternoon summer school program that city officials said cost $24 million. They said additional savings were realized by downsizing office space, or, in the case of the Transportation Department, switching from painting new bus lanes with red paint to using red asphalt.

In that respect, the proposed budget may dampen criticism that the mayor, who is midway through his term, has been spending too much on liberal causes, especially as the city prepares for what appear to be harder economic times on the horizon. It could also help in projecting a more nuts-and-bolts image of the mayor, who despite a recent bump in his approval ratings, is still battling a perception that he is more focused on pushing his agenda rather than running the city.

The 47-page summary released on Thursday included seven pages on the prospect of an economic downturn, including two pages that sounded almost apocalyptic. They bore the same heading, “Impact of Recession,” and one page warned of city revenues plummeting and greater demands on city services.

There are other possible hurdles, including Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and state legislators. New York City relies on the state for funds, and budget negotiations have only just begun in Albany. While the governor’s proposed budget earmarked billions of dollars in spending to help combat homelessness, it also called on the city to increase its contribution to the City University of New York system and to Medicaid costs.

However, I noticed that for a coming trip, the collected information has me listed in the completely wrong hotel. I don’t know how this happened, but can I get rid of the incorrect information in the Trips grouping?

A. Google’s Trip Bundles feature, introduced for Inbox last year, scans the contents of your incoming messages for things like flight reservations, hotel confirmations and rental car bookings in the same time period, but it can sometimes grab the wrong information. For example, if you booked your flight online and your email receipt contained advertisements or suggested hotels in your destination location, one of those suggestions may have been folded into the Trip Bundle accidentally. Also, if you book one hotel and then cancel it for another, the Trip Bundle may keep the original reservation.

Although Trip Bundles were difficult to edit at first, Google recently added the ability to move selected email messages into an existing trip. To add an open message (like one with the correct hotel reservation) on your phone’s screen to a Trip Bundle, tap the icon depicting three vertical dots in the top-right corner. In the Move To menu, select Trips and on the next screen, choose the appropriate trip. To remove a message from the grouping (but not your Inbox), open the Trip Bundle and in the Related Emails list below the trip information, select the errant message. Tap the Move To icon in the top-right cover and choose “Remove from this trip.”

If the wrong hotel still persists in the bundle, you might try removing the related email that mentions the establishment from the bundle first — even if it contains your flight information — put it into a new message and send it to yourself.

“If battery storage is going to work,” he said, “most of it needs to look like this.”

It has been so successful that officials at the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, or Septa, said on Thursday that they are expanding to seven more stations. Officials estimate the program has already saved about $40,000 in electricity costs for each substation and brought in revenue of $250,000 a year since it started running in 2012.

“We don’t have to front the money and we’re reaping both savings and actually money coming back our way,” said Jeffrey D. Knueppel, general manager of the transportation authority.

It has been used in locomotives for years, but operators have only recently been finding ways to recycle the energy into electricity to power their fleets.

Mr. Cameron, although otherwise occupied in Switzerland, had prepared a statement to show his support for the project, too: “From Asia to America, they’re dancing to our music, watching our films and wearing our designers’ latest creations,” the statement said. “With all this talent, it’s no wonder that our creative industries form the fastest-growing part of the economy.”

Liz Moyer reports in DealBook. Mr. Dimon received $27 million, much of it in stock linked to the bank’s performance, a week after the bank recorded a record profit of $24.4 billion for the year, according to a securities filing. Pay disclosures are being scrutinized as banks face pressure from shareholders to overhaul pay practices. This has caused many of them to shift more pay to stock that will be granted only if the company meets certain performance goals. JPMorgan started using performance share units as part of the variable pay for its top executives this year. Its shareholders nearly voted down 2014 pay for the top executives at last spring’s annual meeting, prompting the move to performance-based awards. Overall compensation on Wall Street is down as companies grapple with volatile markets. Goldman Sachs did not raise the amount of money it set aside for employee pay, and pay declined at the investment bank and wealth management divisions of Morgan Stanley. Mr. Dimon’s salary remained at $1.5 million, but his cash bonus dropped to $5 million from $7.5 million the year before. His stock award, however, jumped to $20.5 million from $11.1 million.

HILLARY CLINTON’S OPPONENTS ATTACK HER PAID SPEECHES TO WALL STREET | Hillary Clinton’s paid speeches are emerging as a central line of attack in the bitter primary clash with Senator Bernie Sanders, Nicholas Confessore and Jason Horowitz report in The New York Times. Mr. Sanders has argued that Mrs. Clinton is too personally beholden to Wall Street to effectively rein in the industry’s excesses. He even appeared to mock her speaking fees as borderline bribes from a powerful industry: “You got to be really, really, really good to get $250,000 for a speech.” The attacks have garnered Mr. Sanders applause in Iowa, where the median household earns about $52,229 a year. Republican strategists are also testing how they can use Mrs. Clinton’s speaking fees against her in an election defined by rising economic inequality and stagnant middle-class wages. Even her supporters are questioning the wisdom of accepting the fees when she knew she might run for the presidency again. Mrs. Clinton has tried to parry this by highlighting her support for tighter regulation and comparing herself to President Obama, who took campaign contributions from Wall Street but went on to enact some of the furthest-reaching financial regulations in decades. Mr. Obama has never earned speaking fees from Wall Street. Some believe her biggest vulnerability is not her position on financial regulation, but her personal relationship with Wall Street executives and the millions of dollars she, her husband and their family foundation have accepted in speaking fees and charitable donations from banks, hedge funds and asset managers. Mrs. Clinton and her husband have earned more than $125 million in income from speeches since 2001 — one-fifth of that in the last two years. Mrs. Clinton’s speechmaking has been a tour through high finance from GTCR, the Chicago private equity firm that the Republican governor of Illinois, Bruce Rauner, helped found, to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. “Although they needed money, I think that Bill was raking in enough that Hillary didn’t have to do it,” said Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor, who has supported Mrs. Clinton. “To people who earn $200,000 in seven years, it looks ridiculous.”

Real climate leadership would follow through on the president’s 2008 pledge to advance development of carbon abatement technologies for all fossil fuels.

“Chelsea Does Racism” is considerably better, doing what Ms. Handler was always good at on “Chelsea Lately”: going places where Jay Leno-type hosts never would. Celebrity visitors like the comedian Margaret Cho get things started with some funny and blunt talk, and then Ms. Handler has a bracing round table with representatives of various groups that work on race issues. She lets them pummel her a bit for incendiary remarks she made in the past and tosses out ideas intended to provoke: It’s all right to say black people are good at sports, isn’t it?

“It’s not a compliment, and I’ll tell you why,” the scholar Darnell Hunt explains. “Stereotypes are created for a purpose; they don’t fall from the sky. They always are attached to a political agenda that’s about certain groups being able to dominate other groups.

It means they are not suited for other types of work that involve intellect and other types of abilities more aligned with being affluent.”

Less successfully, Ms. Handler travels to the South and interviews some white people who are clueless about how racist they sound, a technique that has already been run into the ground by “The Daily Show.” Still, there’s an edge to this installment that’s lacking in “Marriage,” a quality one hopes Ms. Handler will bring to the talk show she is scheduled to introduce on Netflix later this year.

The Google powerhouse traded on Friday morning with an equity value above $500 billion, less than 10 percent shy of Apple’s value. Investors value the search firm’s earnings from rapidly growing digital advertising more than twice as highly as Apple’s in a saturating smartphone market. Wall Street, however, may be overlooking Alphabet’s risks.

Global smartphone sales growth slowed to 10 percent last year, according to the consulting firm IDC. Reports of cutbacks at Apple suppliers suggest tepid demand for its latest phones. Analysts fear that the company may struggle this year to match the 230 million or so iPhones sold in the last fiscal year to September.

An oversupplied market could bring price wars, which could hurt margins — and the iPhone accounts for about 60 percent of Apple’s revenue and a bigger chunk of its profit. As a result, investors expect little growth in the company’s top line this year and are paying only about 10 times estimated 2016 earnings for the stock.

The mobile digital advertising market, meanwhile, should almost triple to nearly $200 billion globally by 2019, consultants at eMarketer reckon. Alphabet’s sales are forecast to grow about 15 percent this year.

As a member of the N.F.L.’s compensation committee, he was instrumental in pushing Goodell’s compensation from $2.5 million in 2007 to $44 million in 2012.
During the Ray Rice domestic abuse debacle, Kraft was one of the few owners to publicly come to Goodell’s defense.
The most important example was the Patriots’ 2007 Spygate scandal, in which the team was caught videotaping an opposing coach’s hand signals.
Once the Wells report was issued, with its faulty science and its circumstantial evidence, Goodell did what he had to do.","['underinflated', 'goodells', 'evidence', 'deflategate', 'lies', 'nfls', 'behavior', 'owners', 'commissioner', 'true', 'fine', 'patriots', 'nfl', 'scandal', 'goodell', 'kraft']","One reason people say Kraft feels betrayed, perhaps the main reason, is that Goodell owes him. He was a strong backer of Goodell to become N.F.L. commissioner. He advised Goodell at every turn, and lavishly praised him. As a member of the N.F.L.’s compensation committee, he was instrumental in pushing Goodell’s compensation from $2.5 million in 2007 to $44 million in 2012. He has been a key figure in every television rights deal and labor negotiation. During the Ray Rice domestic abuse debacle, Kraft was one of the few owners to publicly come to Goodell’s defense. He was — and remains — a powerful owner, who has used that power to buttress the N.F.L. commissioner. The two men also developed a close friendship.

But Kraft owed Goodell as well. The most important example was the Patriots’ 2007 Spygate scandal, in which the team was caught videotaping an opposing coach’s hand signals. Although the Patriots paid a $250,000 fine and forfeited a draft choice — and Coach Bill Belichick was fined $500,000 — Goodell ordered that the evidence the Patriots turned over to the league, including a handful of incriminating tapes, be immediately destroyed. Many of the other owners believed that the Patriots had done far worse than steal signals, and that Goodell’s order to destroy the evidence was a cover-up to help his friend Kraft. They were furious.

In truth, the other owners’ resentment of the Patriots went beyond Spygate. In a league built for parity, the Patriots have become the football version of the old Yankees. They are never rebuilding, and always contending. There was resentment over Kraft’s Svengali-like hold on Goodell. And there was jealousy over the Patriots’ success. Although Kraft runs perhaps the most stable franchise in the N.F.L. — who else has had the same coach for 16 years? — many owners were convinced that the team’s success could only be explained by cheating. With the dour, unlikable Belichick as the coach, it was easy enough to believe. After all, he had run a spying operation.

Deflategate was their revenge. Taken at face value, slightly deflated footballs hardly merit the kind of harsh punishment Goodell meted out. In 2012, the San Diego Chargers were caught using “grip enhancing” towels; a fine of $20,000 was levied, and that was only because an equipment manager was said to have ignored a referee’s instruction. (The fine was later overturned.)

And the underinflated balls — if they were underinflated — certainly didn’t affect the game. In the first half, using the supposedly underinflated footballs, Brady and the Patriots took a 17-7 lead. In the second half, with the balls reset at the legal 12.5 p.s.i., the Pats scored 28 consecutive points, making the final score, 45-7.

But that wasn’t the point. The other owners, feeling that the Patriots had been caught cheating a second time, wanted Goodell to crush them. Indeed, although the N.F.L. denies this, it was made clear to the commissioner that there would be repercussions for him if he went too easy on the Patriots. Once the Wells report was issued, with its faulty science and its circumstantial evidence, Goodell did what he had to do. He lowered the boom on his friend, adviser and protector, Kraft.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/23/sports/football/nfl-ignores-ball-deflation-science-at-new-england-patriots-expense.html

“We believe that technology alone is not going to solve any problem,” she said.

At Wadleigh, administrators tend to view Kinvolved as a detection system for habitual absenteeism — not as a means to address underlying problems, like family illnesses, job loss or homelessness, which may cause students to miss school.

“Kinvolved is a tool that gives us the attendance number, but it doesn’t give us the qualitative information that will allow us to address the issue,” said Mr. Bangura, Wadleigh’s community school director. “There are legitimate and structural reasons that some students are late to school” — like the responsibility to drop off younger siblings at a babysitter — “and we are trying to put some solutions in place by communicating with the family.”

Anybody can come into my office and say, “Hey, I want to have a cup of coffee with you.” I remember being so motivated by a leader who always felt so accessible even though he spent all of five minutes with me.

I’ve also learned over time that you can’t do too many things well. And so you narrow the focus down to the things that truly matter, which forces you to prioritize ruthlessly. Sometimes you just have to say that you’re not going to that meeting. That takes some self-confidence and discipline.

How do you hire? What qualities are you looking for?

Are they open, do you like them, does their style mesh with yours and the rest of the team? Do they care about things beyond just their own success? Those are things that are hard to test for. You have to spend time with people to get to know them.

I typically do a lot of reference checks. It’s amazing what you’ll find if you just are persistent and ask the right questions. And hiring for a specific role because they just did that role elsewhere is a good starting point, but I look at candidates much more broadly.

Can this person stretch? Can we make a judgment that this person can learn new things, and it doesn’t have to be business-related. They could be passionate about something completely different. You have to put them at ease to get them to talk about those interests.

We also have a broad set of interviewers — we have a minimum of four at Google — that gives you diverse points of view and then you connect to see if this is the right person. Diversity of thought is actually the most invaluable thing in a business community. If we’re always agreeing with each other, then we haven’t gone down paths of debate that allow new ideas to emerge.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/technology/amit-singh-of-google-for-work-a-respectful-clash-of-ideas.html
368,Kamasi Washington’s Giant Step,2016-01-24,['Adam Shatz'],"Soon Rickey Washington left, too, moving to Inglewood, and Kamasi split his time between the two homes.
Some of Washington’s friends in junior ­high school carried guns, and he flirted with gangster style and speech.

The middle child of his parents’ three sons, he was born in 1981, at the beginning of an era plagued by crack cocaine, gang warfare and police brutality that culminated a decade later in the Rodney King riots. The first house he lived in, on 74th and Figueroa in South Central, was, he said, ‘‘deep in the hood.’’ (At one point, Rickey found the body of a prostitute in the backyard.) When he was 3, his parents divorced, and his mother, a chemistry teacher, moved to a better part of South Central. Soon Rickey Washington left, too, moving to Inglewood, and Kamasi split his time between the two homes. Both neighborhoods were a considerable step up from 74th and Figueroa, Kamasi said, but still ‘‘there were gunshots and sirens every night.’’

A gifted student in math and science, Washington was at once scared of the gangs and enamored of them. The Bloods and the Crips had emerged after the decline — or destruction, as many in South Central would say — of nationalist organizations like the Black Panther Party and exerted an almost irresistible mystique. Some of Washington’s friends in junior ­high school carried guns, and he flirted with gangster style and speech. ‘‘I don’t think my parents understood how off I was,’’ he recalled. What dispelled the glamour of the gangs for him was ‘‘The Autobiography of Malcolm X.’’ He was given a copy by a group of men who visited his school; they were from a nationalist organization called Ujima, Swahili for the principle of collective work and responsibility. ‘‘I saw that these ideas weren’t random, that there was a force behind them,’’ Washington said. ‘‘I realized I didn’t want to be a part of our self-destruction. I wanted to be a positive force in the world.’’

His turn to jazz was hardly unexpected. ‘‘Kamasi was hearing ‘A Love Supreme’ before he even knew what he was listening to,’’ his father told me. He started out on drums at 3 and began studying the clarinet at 9. But Kamasi says he mostly listened to hip-hop until he was 11, when a friend of his older brother gave him a mixtape of Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers with the trumpeter Lee Morgan. (That friend, Lamar Van ­Sciver, is now a hip-hop and R&B producer.) ‘‘That’s when I finally got into jazz,’’ he said. ‘‘All of a sudden, I became aware of all this music I had around me at home.’’ He studied his father’s vinyl collection and taught himself to play Wayne Shorter songs on soprano saxophone.

At 13, Washington announced to his father that he wanted to be a jazz musician. To test his seriousness, Rickey asked his son to sing a Charlie Parker solo. (‘‘I knew if you couldn’t sing it, you couldn’t play it,’’ Rickey said.) Kamasi sang the head and solo of Parker’s 1951 bop classic ‘‘Blues for Alice’’ note for note. His father’s reward was a Conn 6M alto saxophone, the same model Parker played. He played the alto in church for nearly a year, then switched to tenor — his father’s. ‘‘He took my tenor!’’ Rickey said. ‘‘A Selmer Mark VI, the best saxophone they make. He didn’t realize how valuable it was.’’ It’s the only tenor Kamasi has ever played.

Coltrane became his obsession. His favorite record was ‘‘Transition,’’ a defining work of Coltrane’s classic quartet. It was avant-­garde yet still melodic, exhilaratingly expressive but never chaotic. ‘‘He was just treading a line in a way that was powerful,’’ Kamasi said. ‘‘ ‘Transition’ was like the rarest of the rare steaks without being raw. You could still eat it.’’ He modeled himself on Coltrane, not just his sound but also his legendary practice regimen — as long as 12 hours a day, with sometimes hours spent on a single scale or even a single note. Washington was soon averaging nine hours a day; as if to summon the master’s spirit, he often worked on Coltrane tunes. He and Cameron Graves, who is now his pianist, ‘‘used to compete with each other to see who could practice the most.’’ It was a monkish existence, Washington said. ‘‘Becoming a musician is a strange thing. It’s not all cupcakes and ice cream. You’re trying to master an instrument, and you sometimes can’t tell if you’re getting better. You love it, but you also hate it.’’

It was not long after he took up the tenor sax that Washington met another jazz ‘‘guard’’: Reggie Andrews, a music teacher at Locke High School in Watts. Andrews, whose former students included Rickey Washington, had grown frustrated that the city’s magnet schools had poached the best young musicians — including Kamasi Washington, who was discovering Prokofiev and Stravinsky at Alexander Hamilton High School, a prestigious musical academy near Culver City. Andrews began visiting nearby schools and asking the music teachers to identify their best pupils. His idea was to pick them up in his van after school, drive them to Locke and turn them into a group. He called it the Multi-School Jazz Band, and before long it was performing throughout the city. I drove with Washington to Locke, a squat structure surrounded by a wire fence that made it look more like a prison than a school. ‘‘The amazing thing is that white kids were coming down to Locke to rehearse because the band was so good and they wanted to be in it,’’ he remembered. ‘‘It was kind of ironic, since we were being bused to their schools.’’ Seeing young whites flock to Locke gave Washington a taste of power, an awareness of the cachet he possessed as an African-American musician. In spite of the ‘‘denial of our humanity,’’ he realized, ‘‘everybody wants to dress and talk like us.’’",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/magazine/kamasi-washingtons-giant-step.html

We don’t want a palace or some luxury life.’’

When the rest of his family left in March, Waseem thought he would have to wait for about a month at the most. One month was now eight. As it grew colder, he stopped walking along the highway looking for illegal construction jobs. The market for day laborers was drying up. He didn’t dare ask for work in the strip of neon-lit shawarma stands downtown, even though many were staffed by fellow refu­gees. If he was caught working, Waseem could be imprisoned, transferred to the refugee camps, where only the poorest of the poor live, or sent back to Syria. Still, he had to find a way to pay the $247 rent on the apartment he once shared with his parents. He and Noorhan relied increasingly on whatever Mahmoud could send back from America. Instead of helping to support his parents, he was taking from them. ‘‘My father used to be a wealthy man,’’ Waseem said, recalling Mahmoud’s locksmith business in Abu Dhabi. Once the war began, Mahmoud sold the business for $120,000. For nearly five years, that money supported more than a dozen family members in five different countries. Now the money was gone.

Among Syrian refugees, ‘‘on hold’’ is the most dreaded category. It is extremely difficult to get clear answers about why the hold has been applied or when it will be lifted. To try to learn more, Waseem designated The New York Times as a third party with the legal right to inquire about his case. In response to an email from The Times in November, the International Organization for Migration would say only that Waseem’s case ‘‘is currently on hold pending further review by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.’’

Officials cannot comment on individual cases, but when briefed on the case as a hypothetical, immigration officers and resettlement experts offered several possible explanations: It could be as simple as an applicant’s security clearance having expired while a family member waited to be vetted. Or maybe Waseem’s name sounds like a name on a terrorist watch-list. Or maybe, at the very last minute, ‘‘recurrent vetting’’ raised a red flag. Recurrent vetting, which began in 2015, checks names through a series of databases right up to when the flight lands in the United States. As a senior intelligence officer with the National Counterterrorism Center described it: ‘‘If you have an 800 credit score and you’re good for a new Visa card, and two weeks from now they find out that, hey, two years ago, you changed your name to cover up a prior bankruptcy, then they can take away that card.’’

Or maybe it was Azizeh’s brother. As a former military member of the Assad regime, he might still count as a black mark. Even though he defected early on, he could, by some bureaucratic oversight, still be designated a security risk to the United States. When reached in Qatar this fall, via Skype, he expressed relief that all of his family had made it out of Syria alive. He, too, was searching for a new country. ‘‘I’m not looking for beauty or history,’’ he said. ‘‘I’m looking for a country with human rights and freedom.’’ Other family members described specific questions regarding Azizeh’s brother posed to them by American immigration officers in Jordan. For example, did they serve him coffee or tea when he was in their homes? This was most likely a question to determine whether the family had provided material support — which could include a cup of coffee, a glass of water, a ride — to someone designated to be an enemy of the United States.

WASHINGTON — The last time Congress weighed in on rules for nonmilitary drones, in 2012, the flying machines were hardly a hit with consumers. And companies said little about using them for commercial purposes.

Now Congress is set to make a stand again. But this time, hundreds of thousands of recreational drones are in use, and companies like Amazon have their hearts set on using drones to deliver packages — and they are taking their case to Capitol Hill.

The efforts in the halls of Congress are to shape the Federal Aviation Administration’s approach to drone rules on safety and privacy. They are part of a multifront intervention by advocates for broader drone use as well as by their opponents, who argue that the machines pose significant safety and privacy risks. Together, the two sides have quickly emerged as a vocal and passionate contingent in this city.

“Now that there is so much interest and money in drones, everyone wants to get their say” said Ryan Calo, an assistant professor of law at the University of Washington who is focused on robotics. A bill under consideration in Congress “is a way for people who aren’t getting what they want out of the process or getting it fast enough to get their views injected.”

The goals of the drone hobbyists, companies and safety advocates differ in some ways. Hobby groups are trying to peel back recreational registration rules, while airline pilots are pushing for more mandates that drone makers like DJI and GoPro put safety technology on machines. Amazon and Google, which want to use drones for delivery, are asking permission to test their technology. They agree, though, that the F.A.A. is due for fresh guidance on its approach to drone rules.

On Capitol Hill, where much of the attention has turned in recent weeks, lobbyists are focusing on a reauthorization bill for the F.A.A. The bill gives the agency guidance on regulations and funding for projects like commercial drone testing sites. It can also include more specific instructions, like for the agency to strengthen — or loosen — safety and privacy rules for the use of drones.

Lawmakers are close to finishing a draft on the bill, which several congressional aides said would include mandates on drones. A draft could be completed by early February, the aides said. It is unclear if the lobbying efforts will have much effect on lawmakers; aides said various lobbyists who have asked for meetings are asking for a broad set of provisions.

In recent months, lobbyists have scrambled for meetings with officials at the F.A.A., the White House, and a division of NASA that is proposing a drone traffic management system. The Academy of Model Aeronautics, which represents hobbyists, and trade groups for companies like Google and Amazon, are even showing up at city hall hearings in Miami and Los Angeles to influence local rules.

Yet, Amazon and Google clearly see the reauthorization bill as an opportunity to advance their goal of using drones to deliver packages from warehouses to doorsteps. Drone deliveries are now restricted, and proposed rules by the F.A.A. would keep those drones grounded for the foreseeable future. The companies are pushing lawmakers to allow for experimental testing of drone delivery in sparsely populated areas and more research and development of delivery plans, according to Michael E. Drobac, a leader of Akin Gump’s unmanned aerial vehicle lobbying practice, which represents Amazon.

“We expect regulations to come in stages,” Mr. Drobac said. “Any delivery company will look for mechanisms now for delivery in less densely populated areas.”

Amazon and Google have also pushed lawmakers to apply pressure on the F.A.A. to move faster with their first-time rules for commercial drones, Mr. Drobac said. The rules are not expected to allow delivery at first, but lobbyists say it could be an important first step forward in their plans.

“Companies want to be able to benefit from drones by flying beyond visual line of sight, or near congested areas or over people, in a way that is safe,” said Lisa Ellman, a lawyer at Hogan Lovells, which represents commercial drone hardware and software makers. “The F.A.A. is taking steps in that direction, but slowly.”

GoPro, DJI and other makers of recreational drones, meanwhile, are lobbying against more rules. In December, the F.A.A. introduced its mandatory registration system for recreational drone users, and some lawmakers and safety advocates said the agency needs to go further to prevent collisions in the air and to keep users accountable. DJI and GoPro executives sat on the F.A.A.’s task force that came up with recommendations for the registration system that began in December.

The Air Line Pilots Association has been urging lawmakers to require point-of-sale registration at retail stores or online. And it is lobbying for provisions in the reauthorization bill that would require “sense and avoidance” technology that would automatically steer a drone away from a nearby object.

“The proliferation of these vehicles has reached a point where there needs to be a more aggressive approach to safety,” said Tim Canoll, president of the Air Line Pilots Association.

Some of those concerns were echoed last week by Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, the group that will oversee the drafting of the F.A.A.’s reauthorization bill. He wrote letters to the F.A.A., Department of Homeland Security, NASA, and Pentagon calling on them to coordinate on drone safety and security.

Every time a drone is spotted “near an airport runway, or used to smuggle contraband over a prison wall, reminds us that this technology poses another kind of threat,” Mr. Nelson wrote. “I ask that your agencies increase collaboration to mitigate the risk.”",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/drone-lobbying-turns-to-captiol-hill/

As chief executive of Alphabet, Mr. Page is tasked with figuring how to spin Google’s billions in advertising profits into new companies and industries. When he announced the reorganization last summer, he said that he and Sergey Brin, Google’s other founder, would do this by finding new people and technologies to invest in, while at the same time slimming down Google — now called Google Inc., a subsidiary of Alphabet — so their leaders would have more autonomy.

Publishing such collections has become a routine step in completing an author’s legacy. In an email interview, Sutherland said the poet Alexander Pope, who published a book of his letters in 1737, was one of the first writers to realize that “his correspondence would monumentalize his reputation for posterity.”

But correspondence is a vulnerable path to that posterity, threatened by factors both conscious and unconscious. In 1860, Charles Dickens set fire to many of the letters he had written over the course of two decades. He commemorated the incineration in — what else? — a letter to a friend: “They set up a smoke like the genie when he got out of the casket on the seashore; and as it was an exquisite day when I began, and rained heavily when I finished, I suspect my correspondence of having overcast the face of the heavens.” “Dickensian scholars would have sold their souls for that barbecue fuel,” Sutherland said. “There survive, of course, about 15,000 Dickens letters. But whole tracts of the private Dickens will be forever lost.”

Even when letters do survive, they commonly suffer from what Sutherland called the “one-hand-clapping phenomenon,” in which only one side of a written exchange is available. And in recent decades technology has changed the frequency, substance and accessibility of communications.

“The traditional use of letters for the ‘life and letters’ biography is going to be tricky in future,” Sutherland said. “Or perhaps, if some way of getting to all that correspondence in the cloud is found (the delete key never deletes, one is told) it may be enriched and enhanced.

The mystery is as follows: Collectively, American businesses currently have $1.9 trillion in cash, just sitting around. Not only is this state of affairs unparalleled in economic history, but we don’t even have much data to compare it with, because corporations have traditionally been borrowers, not savers. The notion that a corporation would hold on to so much of its profit seems economically absurd, especially now, when it is probably earning only about 2 percent interest by parking that money in United States Treasury bonds. These companies would be better off investing in anything — a product, a service, a corporate acquisition — that would make them more than 2 cents of profit on the dollar, a razor-thin margin by corporate standards. And yet they choose to keep the cash.

Take, for example, Google. Its new parent company, Alphabet, is worth roughly $500 billion. But it has around $80 billion sitting in Google’s bank accounts or other short-term investments. So if you buy a share in Alphabet, which has sold for roughly $700 lately, you are effectively buying ownership of more than $100 in cash. With $80 billion, Google could buy Uber and its Indian rival Ola and still have enough left over to buy Palantir, a data-mining start-up. Or it could buy Goldman Sachs outright or American Express or most of MasterCard; it could buy Costco or eBay or a quarter of Amazon. Surely it could use those acquisitions to earn more than 2 cents on the dollar.

This strange vogue for corporate hoarding seems to have begun around the turn of the millennium. General Motors is perhaps the most extreme: It now holds nearly half its value in cash. Apple holds more than a third. These numbers are maddening on their face. If the companies spent their savings, rather than hoarding them, the economy would instantly grow, and we would most likely see more jobs with better pay. In the 1990s, when companies saved far less of their profits, they built new factories, bought new buildings. In part because of all that corporate spending, the 1990s were a period of low unemployment and high growth. Remarkably, the United States government was able to tax all that productive corporate behavior so much that it came close to paying off all its debts for the first time in 160 years.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/magazine/why-are-corporations-hoarding-trillions.html

Growth investors need to sell a company’s shares and drive down the price until it is low enough to tempt value investors, who buy stocks they think are cheap compared with the intrinsic value of the company. In the tech industry, a shift from growth to value also often signals to investors that a company is facing newer competitors with more innovative products, raising the question of how relevant the company can remain.

A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.

Any change would have repercussions beyond Apple because its soaring performance in recent years helped lift the broader market.

It is not clear to what extent David tested his weapon before doing battle, but he presumably had experimented. The first Book of Samuel tells how he had earlier struck and killed a lion and a bear that menaced the sheep he tended.

381,Travelers in the Dark,2016-01-25,['Eleanor Lew'],"Eleven blind and partially sighted “travelers in the dark” range in age from 28 to 80 and come from diverse backgrounds.
Like me, he became partially sighted in one second, and we anticipate that the rest of our sight could vanish the same way.
For me an invaluable part of the curriculum is learning to teach others how to maneuver me safely through narrow passages, dark theaters and boisterous crowds.
Introducing us to the scope of low-vision rehabilitation services so that we can live independently and maintain quality of life is the purported reason for the camp.
Once home, I ask again: Why don’t more ophthalmologists refer patients to low-vision rehabilitation services?","['services', 'fear', 'sighted', 'way', 'travelers', 'help', 'dark', 'partially', 'blind', 'lowvision', 'rehabilitation']","Photo

At 5, whenever my mother turned off the bedside lamp, an inexplicable terror catapulted me out of bed. Crawling on the floor, I checked to see that everything still existed.

Now it is like that again. Walking into a dimly lit restaurant, I panic when daylight switches instantly to pitch black. Descending a staircase, I fall when the handrail stops short of the last two steps. Emerging into bright sunlight, or confronting a computer screen’s glare, causes me to shield my eyes like a vampire.

I was told I had hereditary degenerative myopia at age 8, and now in middle age, I also have macular degeneration in one eye and fast-growing cataracts in both. My ophthalmologist worries about my visual acuity. But because I don’t yet qualify as legally blind, he doesn’t give me a referral for any kind of vision rehabilitation. “But doctor,” I protest, “I’m blind in the dark and bright light, and have lost depth perception.”

A year ago I heard about a low-vision immersion program offered by the LightHouse for the Blind. I was reluctant to go at first because, being partially sighted, I could not identify with the word “blind.” A year of tripping and falling has convinced me otherwise.

The training camp sits on 311 acres of rolling hills and steep trails about 50 miles north of San Francisco. Eleven blind and partially sighted “travelers in the dark” range in age from 28 to 80 and come from diverse backgrounds.

On the bus ride there I speak with another traveler who lives the way I do — in fear because Damocles’ sword hangs over our heads. Like me, he became partially sighted in one second, and we anticipate that the rest of our sight could vanish the same way. Urgency drives us.

On arrival I notice how broken and reluctant-to-be-there we look. No time for self-pity. Lessons begin an hour after arrival. When I step outside my cabin an instructor greets me and introduces me to my white cane, the dreaded object I fear will make people see only it and not me. But once it’s in my hand and I’m taught how to hold it, I feel steadier and stronger.

We partially sighted folks are forced to face our worst fear right after dinner when we are asked to put on sleeping shades and have our first lesson on coping with daily life in the dark. I’ve often thought about what I would do if I were to drop a sewing needle. The instructor intones the answer in a gentle voice: “Listen for the direction and how far from you it has fallen.” Obvious? Not to me.

In the days that follow we marvel at the unimaginably long list of inexpensive, low-tech gadgets that make doing everyday chores easier, from talking clocks and calculators and dollar bill readers to my favorite, the sock lock that keeps a pair of socks from separating in the wash.

Together we strategize ways to solve problems, like using a rubber band to differentiate a bottle of shampoo from one of hair conditioner. For the fashion-conscious, a fellow student informs us about a color app that “talks,” able to distinguish black from navy or brown.

Sleeping shades on, we clean, cook and shave. I am humbled by my attempt at putting a dab of toothpaste on a toothbrush. I forget to take the cap off.

We test an array of brown, red, purple, green, blue goggles — every pair of eyes is different. I find amber ones help me deal best with bright sun, and yellow are ideal for evening, softening the glare of lights and, with the aid of a small flashlight, allowing me to venture out at night.

Our four days are filled with lessons, both group and one-on-one. Some of us want more extensive help with assistive technologies, especially those that magnify or read text out loud on our smartphones and computers, others with white cane training, cooking, lighting or Braille. My tech instructors, all partly sighted or blind, get a nervous-about-technology me up and running in no time.

Learning how to cross a four-lane street and navigate stairs requires a visit to town. Blindfolded and relying on our ears, we distinguish “parallel traffic” from “perpendicular traffic” to determine when it is safe to cross. I guide myself and two instructors straight into a pile of dog poop.

For me an invaluable part of the curriculum is learning to teach others how to maneuver me safely through narrow passages, dark theaters and boisterous crowds. At last I’ll be able to help my family and friends feel less helpless!

Introducing us to the scope of low-vision rehabilitation services so that we can live independently and maintain quality of life is the purported reason for the camp. But the healing power of connection is what surprises us.

We see, hear and understand one another and relax into gentle teasing and laughter while sharing our stories. In successive days, when any of our blind colleagues master the circuitous trails from their cabins to the dining hall without assistance, we rejoice with them.

The big test comes on our moonless last night. We are to make our way through an unexplored wooded part of the camp to a bonfire. The steep path is less than two blocks long, but I imagine straying off it and wandering alone. My blind roommate and I hook arms and help each other find the trail rope that sporadically disappears in places, and we make it there and back, triumphant.

Once home, I ask again: Why don’t more ophthalmologists refer patients to low-vision rehabilitation services? The costs are typically covered by grants or insurance, but most people don’t know such services even exist.

With knowledge about these services and the help of one, a sense of peace has replaced my childhood terror. Should I ever become blind, I know that my world will not vanish into a black void.",https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/25/blind-low-vision-rehabilitation-services/

“The French aren’t afraid to pick fights with companies,” said Max Schrems, an Austrian law student who brought the original case that upended the previous trans-Atlantic data-sharing agreement.

Ms. Falque-Pierrotin follows a long tradition of French officials promoting strict privacy rights. In 2014, her peers elected her to lead an increasingly powerful group of European privacy regulators — a position that she is the forerunner to retain when new elections take place next month.

The initiative is meant to complement a separate effort to stop Ireland, Luxembourg and other governments from striking favorable deals with individual companies like Apple and Amazon. The plans, set to be unveiled on Wednesday, are part of a legislative package that would require unanimous approval by the European Union’s 28 governments. But commission officials say they are optimistic about eventual approval because many governments need the revenue to support their budgets. —James Kanter",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/25/business/tech-giants-earnings-the-fed-meets-and-a-deadline-on-a-data-sharing-deal.html

Ready or not, here they come.

The last couple of weeks have been a bit of a warm-up to earnings season. Intel and IBM reported lower profits, with their numbers reinforcing how adjusting to the rapidly changing tech industry is hard work, even for longtime giants like them. Both are turning their ships toward big opportunities; the question is how fast they can turn their ships, and whether they will be able to capitalize fully on those opportunities.

But the season hits full swing this week. Apple reports on Tuesday; as Katie Benner reports, investors will be looking for signs that the company continues to be a growth company. Facebook reports on Wednesday; it will be interesting to see how much more of the mobile advertising market they have swallowed. Seattle’s two giants, Amazon and Microsoft, will report on Thursday. Here’s a safe bet with that one: Microsoft will have billions of dollars more in profit.

And there’s more! Alibaba, PayPal, eBay and Qualcomm report as well this week.

Investors like Mr. Li, who has built two other factories here, as well as Chinese state companies, are active all over the country, building highways, digging mines and melting steel.

In Tehran, the Chinese have been involved in the construction of a huge elevated expressway and the building of the Niayesh Tunnel, which at more than three and a half miles will be one of the longest urban tunnels in the world.

James E. Cartwright, a retired Marine general who served as the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during part of Mr. Obama’s first term, was one of the administration’s earliest tech adopters. Eager for a better way to have information at his fingertips in top-secret meetings, General Cartwright was dazzled by the possibilities when the first iPad was unveiled early in 2010.

“If nothing else, in the physical sense, not having to have large binders and four lieutenants to carry them for me,” General Cartwright said of his decision to carry his briefing documents on an iPad. “As soon as people saw it, the race was on: ‘How do I get one?’”

But it wasn’t that easy, he recalled. The general’s iPad was essentially a prototype modified at his direction by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the military’s high-tech lab that helped develop weather satellites, the Internet, GPS, and stealth technology.

The agency made physical alterations to the iPad, removing the cameras, wireless chips, location sensors and microphones. Briefing documents were loaded onto the device every morning via a secure cable. Anything General Cartwright wanted to save came off the device the same way in a process he called “store and dump.”

“What I ended up with was a pretty dumb iPad,” he said. “It wasn’t connected to anything. Anything was removed that could transmit.”

Without such alterations, the general would not have been allowed to take the iPad into the White House Situation Room or other secured rooms known as SCIFs (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities).

A. Apple’s OS X software includes a program called Migration Assistant to transfer user accounts, files and settings from one Mac to another. To use the program, you need a way to connect the two computers. You can link them over the same wireless network or over a wired Ethernet network. Since most new Mac laptops do not include Ethernet ports these days, you can either invest in an adapter that converts a USB port (or one of the newer Thunderbolt ports on some Mac laptops) to an Ethernet port; MacBook models with the single USB-C port may need a USB-C to USB adapter as well.

If your Macs have ports in common, like Thunderbolt, you can hook them together with the appropriate cable. And, as another data-transfer method, if you use Apple’s Time Machine backup software with an external drive, you can use it to move your files from the old Mac to the new one.

Once you get your iTunes library and the rest of your files moved to the new Mac laptop, you need to find a compatible external CD/DVD drive to connect to it so you can resume burning music playlists to disc. Apple recommends its own USB SuperDrive for use with iTunes and many of its Mac models, but it admits that some third-party drives also work.

It is that kind of perspective that drew the attention of trainees already attracted to the human side of medicine.
Dr. Kathleen Drago grew to love geriatrics while training under Dr. Eckstrom.
While making her rounds in the hospital one recent afternoon, Dr. Drago introduced herself to a 79-year-old woman in the intensive care unit.
Dr. Drago sat down and began a frank yet gentle conversation with the patient and her daughter about the next steps.","['driving', 'medicine', 'geriatricians', 'dr', 'patient', 'population', 'geriatrics', 'care', 'training', 'drago', 'older', 'teams', 'ages']","“A lot of us are sick of the whining,” said Dr. Rosanne M. Leipzig, a geriatrician and professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, which is experimenting with a two-year program that combines geriatrics and palliative care.

And there is an emerging emphasis on training many different health care professionals — nurses, pharmacists, internal and family medicine physicians, physician assistants, and physical and occupational therapists — to see older patients through a geriatrics lens rather than focusing solely on creating more geriatricians. Mini-fellowships at teaching hospitals to train practicing physicians in geriatrics have sprung up around the country. Cardiology, urology, emergency medicine and other specialties are promoting geriatrics training and research within those disciplines.

Acknowledging an older person’s need for dignity is an important part of Dr. Eckstrom’s practice. When talking with a patient about giving up driving, she refers to it as “retiring from driving,” casting it as an act of liberation, as if driving were a job to be freed of.

It is that kind of perspective that drew the attention of trainees already attracted to the human side of medicine. Dr. Kathleen Drago grew to love geriatrics while training under Dr. Eckstrom. “I got caught in Elizabeth’s web,” she said. “You meet people who have walked these incredible paths, and are starting to reflect on their lives and focus in on what’s important in the time they have left.”

Dr. Drago, 31, left medical school with a debt of around $270,000. “I made a decision that was distinctly against my own financial interests,” she said. “But I come to work every day, and I get to deliver the patient-centered care that I dreamed of as a med student.”

She now works as a geriatrician at Oregon Health and Science University, seeing only hospitalized patients. Recent evidence about care provided by geriatrics teams shows that with the care of such teams, the hospitalization of older adults runs shorter, costs less and results in fewer complications, including falls, pressure ulcers and urinary tract infections.

While making her rounds in the hospital one recent afternoon, Dr. Drago introduced herself to a 79-year-old woman in the intensive care unit. The patient, who has dementia, had been found lying on the ground the previous night a quarter-mile from her home, bruised and bloodied, with three cracked ribs and bleeding in her brain. She had left the house with a Bible in one hand and an American flag in the other.

MENLO PARK, Calif. — When Facebook releases its fourth-quarter earnings results on Wednesday, it is likely to announce it shows well over eight billion videos a day. It is certainly a big number, but video is most likely a means to an end for Facebook.

Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, says he believes virtual reality will become a widespread computing platform that includes communications, artificial intelligence and voice-activated interactions. He bought Oculus Rift, the maker of virtual reality goggles, for $2 billion to capitalize on that potential.

Video is a building block toward that virtual reality work.

In late 2015, Facebook announced enhanced “360 video,” which is shot with a special camera and rendered so a viewer can manipulate the image to see moving action in every direction.

“There is a shift happening in the business,” said Jay Parikh, vice president of engineering. “Facebook started with text, then photos showed up. Now there are phones always with you with good cameras. People can capture more of their lives in a real times way, much more expressively than a photo and a caption.”

Presumably, these immersive videos will also hold the attention of high-value advertisers.

Building out a network that can handle this load of dense video costs billions of dollars, however. And that is before running a big virtual reality system.

But Mr. Zuckerberg faced a similar challenge when he built Facebook’s global computer network and is now following a similar playbook.

Facebook is adept at open sourcing, or donating for public use, technologies like computer hardware. Much the way open-source software sped development of so-called cloud computing, open-source hardware meant more engineers tackling problems like computer server design.

It is now video’s turn. Last Thursday, Facebook held at its headquarters an all-day event for about 300 engineers from video-related companies like Netflix, Yahoo, Akamai and even YouTube. Facebook talked about technologies in virtual reality, streaming and artificial intelligence related to video.

“From our experience, innovation happens faster in the open,” Mr. Parikh said. “Everything we’re doing in video, live-streaming, 360, all the technology we’re doing in our network, our data centers — that is all heading towards having these experiences in virtual reality.”

Facebook is also looking at ways to make its 360 technology cheaper and more accessible, possibly even within a smartphone. Mr. Parikh declined to comment on these moves.

Facebook also wants to get an even bigger global audience by lowering the cost of connecting to the Internet. While computers run lots of open source hardware and software, related gear in telecommunications has tended to be proprietary and expensive.

On Wednesday, the Open Compute Project, the hardware design sharing group, announced it would move into open sourcing telecommunications gear. AT&T, Verizon and Deutsche Telekom were among the companies signing up.

“A lot of Facebook’s story going forward will be making hardware and software work together with greater efficiency,” said Jason Taylor, who is Facebook’s vice president of infrastructure and the president of the Open Compute Project. “We’re not interested in being a telecom operator, but in our mission to connect the world we need everyone to come together.”",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/27/facebook-readies-a-network-for-virtual-reality/

growth has been consistently weaker than was expected. This has occurred even though interest rates have fallen substantially, suggesting that it reflects a reduction in demand.

The lingering effects of the Great Recession, according to Summers, cast doubt on “the economy’s future potential.” One of the consequences, in Summers’s view, is what economists call “hysteresis” – a term he defines as: “the shadow cast forward on economic activity by adverse cyclical developments.”

Hysteresis, as Investopedia puts it, sounds like something we have seen developing in America, particularly with sinking job force participation numbers (despite lower unemployment):

As unemployment increases, more people adjust to a lower standard of living. As they become accustomed to the lower standard of living, people may not be as determined to achieve the previously desired higher living standard. In addition, as more people become unemployed, it becomes more socially acceptable to be or remain unemployed. After the labor market returns to normal, some unemployed people may be disinterested in returning to the work force.

The views of both Summers and Gordon are controversial, and disputed by other scholars.

For example, a colleague of Gordon’s in the Northwestern economics department, Joel Mokyr, a leading techno-optimist, is on the other side of this debate. In a chapter of an edited volume, “Secular Stagnation: Facts, Causes and Cures,” Mokyr writes

Some of the best economists of our age, including Larry Summers, Paul Krugman, and my own colleague Robert J. Gordon, are joining the chorus of the doomsayers.

But not Mokyr. His response to those who say “that product and process innovation are running out of steam” is “short and simple: we ain’t seen nothin’ yet, the best is still to come.”

Mokyr envisages a world of unprecedented opportunity — where “the tools we have today for scientific research” make “those of Galileo and Pasteur look like stone-age tools”; where digitalization has led to “the reinvention of invention”; where quantum computers will deepen research capacities “by orders of magnitude”; where “what is happening to materials now is nothing short of a sea change, with new resins, ceramics and entirely new solids designed in silico, being developed at the nanotechnological level”; and where the “potential economic significance of genetic engineering is simply staggering, as it completely changes the relationship between humans and all other species on the planet.”

Barry Eichengreen, an economist at Berkeley, takes Gordon to task in a chapter he contributed to “Secular Stagnation”:

For economic historians, this argument flies in the face of 200 years of experience. Pessimists have now been predicting slowing rates of invention and innovation for centuries, and they have been consistently wrong. Looking ahead, it seems clear that the productive potential of robotics and the human genome, for example, have only begun to be realized. Evidence that we are learning how to use intelligent machines to replace first unskilled and eventually skilled labor suggests that we have a distribution problem, not a growth problem.

Two leading technological optimists, Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at M.I.T.’s Sloan School of Management, and Andrew McAfee, a research scientist at M.I.T., argue in their most recent book, “The Second Machine Age,” that “technical progress is improving exponentially:”

The transformations brought about by digital technology will be profoundly beneficial ones. We’re heading into an era that won’t just be different; it will be better, because we’ll be able to increase both the variety and the volume of our consumption.

In this new world, there will be “bounty instead of scarcity, freedom instead of constraint.”

In a phone interview, Brynjolfsson made the point that “we are far from tapping out the innovations” growing out of digitization, computers and information technology. Three-dimensional printing, he said, is “the biggest revolution manufacturing has ever seen.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/27/opinion/campaign-stops/boom-or-gloom.html

SPURNS CALLS FOR A BREAKUP | American International Group has decided to streamline itself, but it remains to be seen whether it can shake off the activist investors that have been pushing for a breakup. The insurance giant, which became the starkest example of “too big to fail” when it had to be rescued during the financial crisis, stopped well short of the outright breakup that some had called for,

Liz Moyer reports in DealBook. It said it would offer part of its mortgage insurance unit in an initial public offering, sell its financial advisory business and create nine distinct operations in its commercial and consumer divisions that could pave the way for future sales or spinoffs. It also plans to spend $25 billion on stock buybacks and dividends over two years, while cutting $1.6 billion from operating costs. Investors, led by Carl C. Icahn, have pushed for a radical breakup so that A.I.G. can avoid the regulatory burden of being labeled a systemically important financial institution, or SIFI, by the government. A.I.G. has resisted this, but Peter D. Hancock, the president and chief executive, has not closed the door entirely to further divestments. “There are no sacred cows,” he said. The strategic shift it has made, however, will only push the insurer toward mediocrity, Antony Currie writes in Breakingviews. Mr. Hancock plans to elevate return on equity next year to a subpar 9 percent. MetLife is expected to do slightly better and Prudential is on track for 14.4 percent. The SIFI designation only costs $150 million a year, but that could change once regulators complete the rules for insurers. Carving up A.I.G. now, though, would mean forgoing almost 10 times that amount in tax benefits. Mr. Hancock may just be providing investors with a road map for a reorganization that creates nine separate divisions. This restructuring story probably has further to go, Mr. Currie says.

IPHONES SALES SLOW | Apple’s latest earnings report shows that iPhone sales rose less than 1 percent from a year earlier — the slowest pace ever for the device which accounts for about two-thirds of the company’s revenue,

Katie Benner reports in The New York Times. Apple’s sales forecast was not much more optimistic, indicating that the sluggishness would continue and projecting the first revenue decline in more than a decade. The numbers raise questions about how Apple will satisfy investors who want growth and consumers who want new, cutting-edge technology. Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said the slowdown reflected greater uncertainties in economies and financial markets. “We’re seeing extreme conditions, unlike anything we’ve experienced before, just about everywhere we look,” he said. Luca Maestri, Apple’s chief financial officer, also said the strength of the dollar had affected the company’s earnings. “In the December quarter alone, the foreign exchange impact was $5 billion to our revenue line,” he said. Other growth areas that Apple has relied upon are also slowing. Sales in the greater China region rose 14 percent in the quarter from a year ago, but annual revenue growth from the region has been 70 percent or more in the previous four quarters.

ACTIVIST INVESTORS MEET THEIR MATCH | The stock market slump has raised the question of whether shareholder activism can survive a down market, Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in the Deal Professor column. In the rising stock market, acquisitions were hot and exits were easy. Mistakes in picking targets were covered up by gains in the market. In a down market, what was volatile on the upside is now shooting downward, bringing this exuberance tumbling back to earth. With troubled companies becoming more troubled and harder to turn around, activists beat a hasty retreat. This happened in the financial crisis of 2008, and history seems to be repeating itself this year with hedge funds, including Pershing Square and Icahn Enterprises, buffeted by the downturn. If the downturn persists, we are likely to see a sharp drop in activism. Many activist hedge funds have only one-year lockups, and the money that has flooded into them could reverse. The result would not only be a reduction in the number of activist attacks. One or two highflying funds may collapse, and some of the stronger funds may survive and buy opportunistically. But not all funds will be able to keep enough cash on hand to invest. In the interim, companies may get the breather they have been desperate for. It is also likely to pause the trend for spinoffs as these companies focus on their core operations rather than financial engineering.

Now, one of those companies has found a way to bury the hatchet.

Lyft, a popular start-up based in San Francisco, agreed late Tuesday to settle a class-action lawsuit brought in 2013 by Lyft drivers in California. The drivers had sought to be recognized as full-time employees who would be eligible for benefits from the company, rather than as independent contractors.

Under the settlement, Lyft drivers will continue to be classified as contractors. The company agreed to pay $12.25 million to those represented in the suit and said it would amend the terms of service to which drivers must agree when signing up with the platform so that they are consistent with the definition of a contractor. The settlement is subject to court approval.

“We are pleased to have resolved this matter on terms that preserve the flexibility of drivers to control when, where and for how long they drive on the platform and enable consumers to continue benefiting from safe, affordable transportation,” Kristin Sverchek, Lyft’s general counsel, said in a news release.

Shannon Liss-Riordan, the attorney representing the drivers in the suit, said in a statement that the settlement would “provide substantial benefits to drivers and distribute reimbursement for some of the expenses they have incurred while driving for Lyft.” Lyft agreed to pay arbitration fees and other costs in claims initiated by the company or drivers, for instance, and Ms. Liss-Riordan said the company would no longer be able to terminate drivers at will; it must find cause to do so.

The employment status of those who work for ride-hailing services and other on-demand companies has become a hot topic of debate. While on-demand companies say independent contractors gain a lot of flexibility by not being full-time employees, critics say the workers are shortchanged because they do not get benefits and other protections. Politicians and others have taken up the issue, which is likely to be closely scrutinized this year during an election cycle.

Uber, Lyft’s chief rival, remains embroiled in a similar class-action suit in California in which drivers are seeking full-time employee status.

Any change in worker classification could hurt the business models of companies like Lyft and Uber. By treating workers as contractors, the companies can keep labor costs low, since they do not need to pay drivers’ payroll taxes and are not subject to minimum-wage and overtime laws.",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/27/lyft-agrees-to-settle-class-action-lawsuit-with-california-drivers/

Artificial intelligence researchers are closing in on a new benchmark for comparing the human mind and a machine. On Wednesday, DeepMind, a research organization that operates under the umbrella of Alphabet, reported that a program combining two separate algorithms had soundly defeated a high-ranking professional Go player in a series of five matches.

The result, which appeared in the Jan. 27 edition of the journal Nature, is further evidence of the power created when a class of A.I. machine learning programs known as “deep neural networks” is combined with immense sets of data.

Go is seen as a good test for artificial intelligence researchers because it is more complex than chess, with a far larger range of possible positions. This makes strategy and reasoning in the game more challenging.

Go is played with round black and white stones, and two players alternately place pieces on a square grid with the goal of occupying the most territory. Until recently, software programs had not been able to do better than beat amateur Go players. In the Nature paper, engineers at DeepMind described a program, AlphaGo, that had achieved a 99.8 percent winning rate against other Go programs. It also swept five games from the European Go champion, Fan Hui.

The match between the AlphaGo program and Fan Hui was in October, and the DeepMind program has continued to train since then, said Demis Hassabis, a researcher who founded DeepMind Technologies, which was acquired by Google in 2014. Google changed its name to Alphabet last year, though the company’s traditional ad-based businesses still operate under the Google label.

“The machine has continued to get better. We haven’t hit any kind of ceiling yet on performance,” he said.

The Alphabet approach relies on the newest so-called deep learning approach combined with a more traditional type of algorithm known as a Monte Carlo, which is designed to exhaustively explore large numbers of possible combinations of moves. The researchers said they had also trained their program using input from expert human Go players.

The research and the game have created a rivalry among the public relations departments of companies like Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook.

The day before the Alphabet paper was published, Facebook republished an earlier paper the company had posted on the arXiv.org website. At the same time, Facebook issued blog posts from Yann LeCun, one of its artificial intelligence researchers, and one from the company’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.

The statement by Mr. Zuckerberg resulted in a swift response from one Facebook user that may express a deeper human concern than the narrow results of the research: “Why don’t you leave that ancient game alone and let it be without any artificial players? Do we really need an A.I. in everything?” wrote Konstantinos Karakasidis.

Those concerns are not likely to be heeded. In a blog post Wednesday morning, Alphabet stated that, in an effort to reprise the winning IBM Deep Blue chess playing program that defeated the chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1996, Alphabet will match its AlphaGo program against Lee Sedol, the current Go champion, for a five-game match in March.

There will be a $1 million prize for the winner, and Mr. Hassabis said that Alphabet would donate the prize to charity if AlphaGo won. The match will be streamed live on YouTube.

Mr. Hassabis, who is a skilled chess player and has been a professional gamer as well, said that Go was a beautiful game, but that “building an A.I. is also a human endeavor and a kind of ingenious one, too. The reason games are used as a testing ground is that they’re kind of like a microcosm of the real world.”",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/27/alphabet-program-beats-the-european-human-go-champion/

Later, he added: “I think it’s appropriate always to resist concentration of power in the hands of too few. There is bound to come a point where that becomes dangerous.”

Google’s power is predicated, of course, on the enormous volume of information at its disposal. Its competitors, as I noted in my profile, have accused the company of abusing its dominance in the search space to steer consumers to Google services over theirs, and the European Commission seems to agree.

But Mr. Page has also used his own power — through an unusual share structure, he and co-founder Sergey Brin control the company outright — to isolate himself from Wall Street’s demands. In the 16 years I’ve been covering business I have met countless C.E.O.s who describe their jobs in almost academic terms, using phrases like “fiduciary duty” to dodge questions about what kind of role their company has to society.

In public comments, Mr. Page goes out of his way to say the opposite, describing Google more in terms of a nonprofit than a gigantic corporation.

Why does Microsoft need so much personal information and what does Microsoft do with it?

A. Personal assistant programs like Cortana and Apple’s Siri are meant to make your life easier by responding to voice commands for sending messages to specific people, locating nearby businesses, adding appointments to your calendar and similar tasks. But to perform those actions, the software needs information from you — like your contacts list for addressing those messages, your location for finding businesses currently near you, or access to your calendar so it can add events.

When you use voice commands with an assistant program (including Siri and Google’s search app), your audio data may also be sent to the company’s servers to process the request and improve speech recognition. Your browsing and search histories are probably collected, too. Companies often claim this is to provide more relevant results, but the data may also be used to help send more targeted advertisements your way.

Could the improbable happen again? The presidential lineup today is unusually tempting for Mr. Bloomberg, the sensible centrist. As he looks at the candidates, he sees a threat to the country in the ignorance of Donald J. Trump, the rigidity of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the extremism of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

The trials came after a half-decade investigation that led to billions of dollars in fines, cost one chief executive his job and damaged the reputations of some of the world’s biggest banks. Lawyers for the six former brokers on trial in London argued that the men were being made scapegoats for a flawed system and that they had lied to Mr. Hayes about their ability to influence the rate. The former brokers worked at the British financial firms ICAP, RP Martin and the Tullett Prebon Group. Prosecutors had accused the men of helping Tom Hayes, a former trader at UBS and Citigroup, and others profit by rigging Libor, which helps determine the borrowing costs for trillions of dollars in loans.

Facebook acquired Parse, a toolkit and support system for mobile developers, in 2013. At the time, the social network’s ambitions were high: Parse would be Facebook’s way into one day harnessing developers to become a true cloud business, competing alongside the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft.

Those ambitions, it seems, have fallen back to earth. On Thursday, Facebook said it plans to shut down Parse, the services platform for which it paid upwards of a reported $85 million.

“We know that many of you have come to rely on Parse, and we are striving to make this transition as straightforward as possible,” Kevin Lacker, co-founder of Parse, said in a blog post. “We enjoyed working with each of you, and we have deep admiration for the things you’ve built.”

Most of what Parse does involves things most people will never see. Parse helps developers with support and tools, so that independent programmers can spend more time writing code and less time on keeping up the back end. Developers who use Parse include those at Quip, a productivity app, and Expedia’s Orbitz, a travel website. Facebook would make money from Parse by storing data from developers and sending customers product notifications.

Achieving that goal, however, would be no easy feat. Microsoft, Google and Amazon have similar developer offerings, along with a much richer set of other computing tools and services that developers need. Amazon Web Services, in particular, has in the past two years stressed both its developer tools and analytic services, so companies can think about what to build next. In every case, these companies can also benefit by selling other computing services, like complex commercial databases, which Facebook does not provide.

At one point, Facebook was willing to take those risks. When Facebook bought Parse in 2013, Facebook’s stock was below its initial public offering price of $38. The company had not grown a robust mobile advertising yet, and Facebook was eager to seek out other lines of business in hopes of future profits, according to two people with knowledge of the company’s plans at the time who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak for the company.

Parse seemed like a good opportunity for expansion. At the time, Internet businesses were in the midst of a major industry change, as users were shifting away from desktop computing and increasingly relying on mobile devices. Parse, the thinking went, could provide Facebook the opportunity to be the foundation of a whole new generation of developers building mobile apps in the age of the smartphone.

Things have changed. Facebook is generating record profits and its mobile advertising business is booming; 80 percent of the company’s advertising revenue now comes from mobile devices. As Facebook’s fortunes have turned, it has shown less interest in pursuing other lines of business outside of what it does best. Instead, the company appears intent on building things that somehow, someday, will feed Facebook’s core ad-based business — and those bets are going to have to get bigger and weirder

Facebook also would have had to invest untold millions of dollars in capital and, more importantly, engineering talent, to get the Parse business fully off the ground to have a better chance at making a dent in competitors like Amazon, Microsoft and Google.

Moreover, Facebook has already made two big, risky bets in Oculus, the virtual reality platform, and WhatsApp, the messaging service. Neither service currently generates material revenue for Facebook.

Parse may have touched millions of people through the apps that developers built there, but that mattered little against Facebook’s size. With more than 1.5 billion registered users, a population of even 15 million customers is not 1 percent of Facebook’s audience. Building up Parse, it seems, eventually became more of a distraction than it was worth.

“Moving forward we want to dedicate more resources to high-impact products and services in areas like analytics, monetization, discovery, and authentication,” Michael Kirkland, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement. “As a result, we’ve made the difficult decision to wind down support for Parse.”

Other Silicon Valley companies have encountered similar difficulties. Inside Cisco Systems, in its heyday, there was pressure to build businesses that yielded $1 billion or more in revenue, since anything less could not affect the overall company. Facebook, which unlike other clouds has not sought to rent computing and software to businesses, must essentially find this from social networking.

Developers who used Parse will have a set of tools and a year-long window to be able to migrate their data off of the platform to other services.

“We’re proud of what we’ve accomplished together with the Parse community, and we thank them for their support,” Mr. Kirkland said.",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/28/facebook-to-shut-down-parse-its-platform-for-mobile-developers/

An over the top reaction to hashtag Pray for Paris

But beyond this planet, and our petty people problems

We sat in a dreary guesthouse on the university campus. Mr. Pandey had just finished a long train ride. With his wrinkled kurta pajama and rubber slippers, he was every bit the picture of an old-fashioned Indian leftist.

That was why he’d been fired. “Ideologically, I am at the opposite extreme to the people who are at present in power,” he said. “These people not only cannot tolerate any dissent; they don’t even tolerate disagreement. They want everybody who disagrees with them out of this campus.” Mr. Pandey was referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party and — more to the point — the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the B.J.P.’s cultural fountainhead.

The R.S.S., a Hindu nationalist organization, was founded in 1925 as a muscular alternative to Mahatma Gandhi’s freedom movement. Its founder admired Adolf Hitler, and in 1948 the organization was blamed for indirectly inspiring Gandhi’s assassination. The B.J.P. has not always had an easy relationship with the R.S.S. With its fanciful ideas of Hindu purity and its sweeping range of prejudices, the organization is dangerously out of step with the realities of India’s political landscape. When the B.J.P. wants to win an election, it usually distances itself from the R.S.S.’s cultural agenda.

Mr. Modi’s 2014 election had very little to do with the R.S.S. and everything to do with his personality and promises of development. But the R.S.S. doesn’t see it that way. Like a fairy-tale dwarf, the group has sought to extract its due from the man it helped into power. As payment for the debt, the R.S.S. wants control of education. Specifically, it wants to install its men at the helm of universities where they will wreak vengeance on the traditionally left-wing intellectual establishment that has always held them in contempt.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/28/opinion/the-right-wing-attack-on-indias-universities.html

Facebook acquired Parse, a toolkit and support system for mobile developers, in 2013. At the time, the social network’s ambitions were high: Parse would be Facebook’s way into one day harnessing developers to become a true cloud business, competing alongside the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft.

Those ambitions, it seems, have fallen back to earth. On Thursday, Facebook said it plans to shut down Parse, the services platform for which it paid upwards of a reported $85 million.

“We know that many of you have come to rely on Parse, and we are striving to make this transition as straightforward as possible,” Kevin Lacker, co-founder of Parse, said in a blog post. “We enjoyed working with each of you, and we have deep admiration for the things you’ve built.”

Most of what Parse does involves things most people will never see. Parse helps developers with support and tools, so that independent programmers can spend more time writing code and less time on keeping up the back end. Developers who use Parse include those at Quip, a productivity app, and Expedia’s Orbitz, a travel website. Facebook would make money from Parse by storing data from developers and sending customers product notifications.

Achieving that goal, however, would be no easy feat. Microsoft, Google and Amazon have similar developer offerings, along with a much richer set of other computing tools and services that developers need. Amazon Web Services, in particular, has in the past two years stressed both its developer tools and analytic services, so companies can think about what to build next. In every case, these companies can also benefit by selling other computing services, like complex commercial databases, which Facebook does not provide.

At one point, Facebook was willing to take those risks. When Facebook bought Parse in 2013, Facebook’s stock was below its initial public offering price of $38. The company had not grown a robust mobile advertising yet, and Facebook was eager to seek out other lines of business in hopes of future profits, according to two people with knowledge of the company’s plans at the time who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak for the company.

Parse seemed like a good opportunity for expansion. At the time, Internet businesses were in the midst of a major industry change, as users were shifting away from desktop computing and increasingly relying on mobile devices. Parse, the thinking went, could provide Facebook the opportunity to be the foundation of a whole new generation of developers building mobile apps in the age of the smartphone.

Things have changed. Facebook is generating record profits and its mobile advertising business is booming; 80 percent of the company’s advertising revenue now comes from mobile devices. As Facebook’s fortunes have turned, it has shown less interest in pursuing other lines of business outside of what it does best. Instead, the company appears intent on building things that somehow, someday, will feed Facebook’s core ad-based business — and those bets are going to have to get bigger and weirder

Facebook also would have had to invest untold millions of dollars in capital and, more importantly, engineering talent, to get the Parse business fully off the ground to have a better chance at making a dent in competitors like Amazon, Microsoft and Google.

Moreover, Facebook has already made two big, risky bets in Oculus, the virtual reality platform, and WhatsApp, the messaging service. Neither service currently generates material revenue for Facebook.

Parse may have touched millions of people through the apps that developers built there, but that mattered little against Facebook’s size. With more than 1.5 billion registered users, a population of even 15 million customers is not 1 percent of Facebook’s audience. Building up Parse, it seems, eventually became more of a distraction than it was worth.

“Moving forward we want to dedicate more resources to high-impact products and services in areas like analytics, monetization, discovery, and authentication,” Michael Kirkland, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement. “As a result, we’ve made the difficult decision to wind down support for Parse.”

Other Silicon Valley companies have encountered similar difficulties. Inside Cisco Systems, in its heyday, there was pressure to build businesses that yielded $1 billion or more in revenue, since anything less could not affect the overall company. Facebook, which unlike other clouds has not sought to rent computing and software to businesses, must essentially find this from social networking.

Developers who used Parse will have a set of tools and a year-long window to be able to migrate their data off of the platform to other services.

“We’re proud of what we’ve accomplished together with the Parse community, and we thank them for their support,” Mr. Kirkland said.",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/28/facebook-to-shut-down-parse-its-platform-for-mobile-developers/

A. Personal assistant programs like Cortana and Apple’s Siri are meant to make your life easier by responding to voice commands for sending messages to specific people, locating nearby businesses, adding appointments to your calendar and similar tasks. But to perform those actions, the software needs information from you — like your contacts list for addressing those messages, your location for finding businesses currently near you, or access to your calendar so it can add events.

When you use voice commands with an assistant program (including Siri and Google’s search app), your audio data may also be sent to the company’s servers to process the request and improve speech recognition. Your browsing and search histories are probably collected, too.

Skeye I for The New York Times

Small-town Iowans have a huge role in picking the next president. Their deep commitment to the process paints a distinct portrait of democracy.

There is a surprising diversity in the physical as well as the political landscape of Iowa’s rural areas, which make up more than three-quarters of the state’s 99 counties and are home to 40 percent of its population.

It’s not all flat farmland. The “driftless area” in the northeastern part of the state, which avoided advancing glaciers thousands of years ago, boasts deep river valleys and towering, tree-covered bluffs.

And it’s not all conservative. Fifty-one percent of voters in the state’s rural counties voted for Barack Obama in 2008, and 48 percent voted for him in 2012.

In a grocery store parking lot in Waukon, a town of 3,900 people, Bob Hager, the Republican chair of Allamakee County, and Jeff Abbas, a Democrat, joked about their political differences.

Mr. Hager described how a co-worker had threatened to steal the Bernie Sanders signs from Mr. Abbas's front yard. Mr. Abbas laughed and said: “I put those up on big T posts, which I electrified underground. So if he touches them, he's in trouble.”

Mr. Abbas, who runs a program that distributes deer meat and foraged food, then struck a more conciliatory tone.

“You can fight like hell about politics, but when it comes down to it, neighbors are neighbors, no matter what,” he said.

Iowa often has its first-in-the-nation voting status called into question, in part because its demographics (the state is 92 percent white) don’t represent the country as a whole. But Iowans will proudly defend their position, citing their deep commitment to the process and the lengths to which they will go to scrutinize the candidates.

And rural Iowans, who may caucus with just a handful of their neighbors on Feb. 1, take their responsibility just as seriously.

Rural Iowans can swing the state.

In the 2012 Republican race, half of Iowa’s counties had fewer than 600 voters caucus, with some caucus sites hosting as few as three people.

And it was the margins in those counties’ tiny precincts that ultimately delivered the victory to Rick Santorum over Mitt Romney.

The yellow circles outside the cities show where Rick Santorum won and by how many votes. Other candidates’ victories are in gray. +34 +37 +19 Tie at these locations +38 +160 +117 +82 +31 +46 +56 +6 +1 vote +52 +107 +5 +271 +41 +34 +37 +19 Tie at these locations +38 +160 +117 +82 +31 +46 +56 +6 +1 vote +52 +107 +5 +271 +41 +34 +37 +19 Tie at these locations +38 +160 +117 +82 +31 +46 +56 +6 +1 vote +52 +107 +5 +271 +41 +1 vote +34 +160 +82 +271 +41 The New York Times | Source: Republican Party of Iowa | Note: Caucus locations may represent multiple precincts. Many rural counties, for example, choose to hold all precinct caucuses at one or two central locations.

Party leaders in rural areas are well aware of the power they hold, whether they vote as a bloc to tip the result in one direction or provide just enough support to cut into a candidate’s margins from the bigger cities.

Kurt Meyer, a longtime Democratic activist, is a sixth-generation resident of a small township in northern Iowa. After years living outside Minneapolis, he returned to build a home in the area. He is now the party chairman for three rural counties bordering Minnesota, including Mitchell County, the whitest in the country to vote for Mr. Obama in 2008 and 2012.

Mr. Meyer is a strong advocate of a “99-county strategy” for Democrats in Iowa, arguing that the party needs to work to engage voters beyond those in urban areas to be successful.

“We can win with an ‘only we carry the urban precinct’ strategy. But our margin of error is minimal in such a strategy,” Mr. Meyer said. “We can win with an ‘only we carry the urban precinct’ strategy. But our margin of error is minimal in such a strategy,” Mr. Meyer said. PLAY

Caucusing, especially in rural areas, requires a higher level of commitment.

Caucuses are run by the parties, not the state, so the bulk of the organizing falls to volunteer committee members, who are driven by a passion less for individual candidates than for their parties’ values and the grass-roots political process.

In 2009, Mary Ellen Miller moved from Mason City, Iowa, to her late brother’s farmland in Wayne County, one of the least-populated counties in the state.

An active Republican for 50 years, she became involved with the county committee and was surprised when she was told in late 2013 that “nobody comes” to the midterm caucuses.

When she suggested offering a free chili dinner, her fellow committee members were skeptical. But they were eventually swayed and offered to contribute hot dogs, coffee and dessert.

“They put it in the paper, and 50 people showed up,” she said. “Blew them away.”

While a caucus is a commitment in itself — the meeting can last a couple of hours — it can be even more difficult to turn out people in rural areas. Voters in these areas have farther to drive on dark, wintry roads, and an older population may prefer to stay in on a cold night, or may be spending the winter somewhere else entirely.

On a drizzly afternoon in early January, Ms. Miller asked some of the men she had invited to hunt deer on her land if they were planning to caucus.

Population loss and aging are reshaping rural politics.

More than half of Iowa’s 99 counties have shrunk in population since 1990, with the most rural areas hit the hardest. The 18- to 34-year-old share of the population has decreased in all but four counties in the state, rural and urban alike.

Each bar represents how much the population in one Iowa county has grown or shrunk since 1990. Smaller, rural counties were hit the hardest.

The shedding of Iowa’s rural population has made it more difficult for the parties to recruit and maintain leaders for their county committees.

At the same time, a growing dependence on out-of-state paid staff members in election years has left many counties without local volunteers who have the skills to maintain their organizations in non-election years.

But in many places, there are still sharp, young organizers who are inspired by their state’s grass-roots tradition and committed to helping their communities re-engage with politics through new approaches and technologies.

“I think being in a rural area, you’re able to step up to the plate and take more responsibilities, which is awesome and a little scary also,” said Jordan Pope, the chairman of the Decatur County Democrats, who, at 18, is the youngest county chairman or chairwoman in Iowa.

“I have friends in Texas and Alabama, and they’re always jealous when they see me taking selfies with presidential candidates,” he said. “Yeah, you have primaries there, but the main way they see their candidates is on a TV screen.”

Mr. Pope spent his winter break from his freshman year of college at home, calling his way through his party’s voter database and preparing for the caucuses.

He also met with other, mostly much older, local organizers to prepare them for a major change this election cycle. He also met with other, mostly much older, local organizers to prepare them for a major change this election cycle. PLAY

For the first time since the caucuses began in 1972, the parties are replacing their paper and landline vote reporting system with a digital one. Precincts will use a smartphone app developed by Microsoft to instantly tally and send in their results.

The parties are hoping to avoid what happened in the 2012 Republican caucuses: The final, verified tally naming Mr. Santorum the winner was not released until more than two weeks after caucus night, when Mr. Romney was said to have won.

Charlie Szold, the communications director for the Republican Party of Iowa, said that with a new, streamlined process this year, the verified tally would be available in 48 hours.

While the app is fairly simple, it has created some anxiety in the most rural parts of the state, where not everyone owns or has experience using a smartphone and Wi-Fi and cellphone service are harder to come by.

Renewable fuels and environmental regulations are issues that loom large.

When it comes to questions of policy, rural Iowans express concern over the same issues as the rest of the country. But many are also particularly affected by less well-known environmental regulations and energy mandates. And while agriculture has decreased as a means of employment in the state, it is still very much the driving force in many rural counties.

“I think as far as farmers are concerned and rural small-business people, we’re tuned in to an extent because we know how involved the government’s become in our business,” said Ryan Frederick, 30, the chairman of the Adair County Republicans, who owns a real estate company and helps run his family’s small farm.

“It’s important to recognize that regulations almost always hurt the little guy,” he said. “And in rural areas, that’s all there is, is little guys.”

One government policy that is a little more complicated for Republicans in rural areas is the Renewable Fuel Standard. It requires that a certain amount of renewable fuels like corn ethanol be blended into transportation fuels, helping the ethanol industry compete with oil and gas, which have long benefited from federal subsidies.

Farmers, like Mr. Frederick, who sell their corn to ethanol plants must balance their preference for less government with their own economic realities. Farmers, like Mr. Frederick, who sell their corn to ethanol plants must balance their preference for less government with their own economic realities. PLAY

Rural politics are uniquely personal.

Party leaders will tell you that political organizing in rural areas isn’t the same as in the cities. It’s a much more personal experience to share your political beliefs with the people you see at the grocery store or at church every week.

The caucuses themselves are not designed for anonymity: Everyone arrives at once and can make a pitch for their favorite candidate in front of the entire group. While the Republicans vote secretly on scraps of paper, the process for Democrats requires caucusgoers to declare their preference by physically standing in a candidate’s designated corner.

But one personal tradition of the Iowa caucuses is actually a rarity these days: Just five precinct caucuses, three Democratic and two Republican, are still held in someone’s home.

Sharon McNutt and her husband, Gary, who have hosted Republican caucuses at their home in rural Mills County for more than a decade, say it helps make politics more accessible to people who may be intimidated by the process.",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/us/elections/rural-iowa-election.html

Consumers would still have to pay their satellite and cable provider for their programming.
The cable bundle, in which people pay for dozens or hundreds of stations or none at all, is expected to remain in place.

In November, Time Warner Cable, for instance, began a trial offering its cable television lineup through devices made by Roku.","['tv', 'companies', 'satellite', 'settop', 'cable', 'programming', 'box', 'proposes', 'contracts', 'pay', 'fcc', 'television', 'proposal', 'market', 'video', 'changes']","“Consumer choice should fuel the video box market, not cable company control,” Senator Markey said on Wednesday. “I commend Chairman Wheeler for his proposal to help ensure that consumers are not captive to bloated rental fees forever.”

Senior officials at the agency said the plan would not affect contracts between cable and media companies. Consumers would still have to pay their satellite and cable provider for their programming. The cable bundle, in which people pay for dozens or hundreds of stations or none at all, is expected to remain in place.

Still, media executives expressed concern that the change could undermine the foundation of their businesses. The concern is that the new arrangement could negate contracts between cable companies and entertainment companies, in which the cable companies pay television groups billions of dollars a year for the rights to distribute programming. Those contracts stipulate how the programming can be distributed, for instance, whether it is included in video-on-demand packages, how it is branded, certain copyright protections and the treatment of advertising.

The executives said the proposal could allow a new set of companies, like Google or Apple, to step in to distribute and sell ads in and around television programming that they neither paid to create, or license. A set-top box can control the flow of data on users’ viewing habits, the sort of information that is at the heart of Google’s business.

“Distributors will be forced to reconsider what they pay for programs that can be siphoned off, repackaged and resold, drying up the revenue needed to underwrite quality shows,” said Alfred C. Liggins, the chief executive of TV One, a digital cable and satellite network that serves 57 million households. “These arrangements — including critical terms such as channel placement, advertising, scheduling and more — are the lifeblood of the video marketplace today.”

Opponents of the proposal also said that the industry was already providing more streaming options and the F.C.C. did not need to intervene to spur innovation. In November, Time Warner Cable, for instance, began a trial offering its cable television lineup through devices made by Roku. Charter Communications also offers subscribers the ability to stream TV through a Roku App. Cox Communications, an Atlanta-based cable company, allows customers to view programming through TiVo.

At the same time, television networks like HBO, Showtime and CBS have introduced a range of à la carte offerings that allow people to subscribe to an individual network without paying for the full cable bundle.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/28/technology/fcc-proposes-changes-in-set-top-box-market.html

In addition to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services inspection, the Food and Drug Administration has curtailed its blood tests and analyses for all but one test, for herpes.

While Ms. Holmes has been insistent that the company will eventually win the necessary regulatory approvals, the letter from C.M.S. fosters continued skepticism over Theranos’s ability to perform these novel tests with a few drops of blood.

In its letter, dated Jan. 25, C.M.S., which is the regulator responsible for overseeing clinical laboratories, detailed five conditions that it said the Newark lab failed to meet. The deficiencies involve oversight and personnel at the lab and the systems used to analyze the tests, the agency said. It declined to comment further.

Much of the agency’s concern surrounded the oversight at the lab. Theranos said the company had made “policy and personnel changes” at the facility, including a new lab director, Dr. Kingshuk Das, a board-certified pathologist.

Theranos had been criticized by outside investors and industry experts for a lack of laboratory-trained executives both on its board and in its management of the company.

While the company must scramble to satisfy C.M.S., it has yet to demonstrate outside confidence in its testing. Walgreens, the drugstore chain that has a pilot program with Theranos in some clinics in Arizona, has not decided whether it will continue the program or commit to expanding the use of Theranos testing outside of Arizona.

For its part, Theranos has said that those discussions were still underway.

Even more important, however, the company has held out the promise of approval by the F.D.A. for myriad other tests besides the one for herpes that was approved last year.

The F.D.A. is also reviewing the company’s analysis machines and processes, and the agency’s approval is required for additional tests. While Theranos is able to use conventional methods to continue its testing, it remains unclear how much of its own technology the company is able to use while awaiting regulatory approval.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/28/business/theranos-lab-found-in-violation-of-clinical-standards.html

Hernandez, the executive chairman of SunEdison’s board, said on Wednesday that the move “makes clear our unequivocal commitment to SunEdison and its common shareholders.”

He added, “As we work to navigate current market conditions, we are very pleased that we will have the benefit of tapping the expertise of a highly qualified director endorsed by a significant shareholder.”

Last year was a particularly rough one for Mr. Einhorn. Halfway through 2015, it appeared as if SunEdison would be a bright spot in his otherwise beleaguered portfolio of stocks. He called it in a letter to investors “our only significant winner” at the time as the stock moved from $24 a share to $29.91 a share over the second quarter. On Tuesday night before SunEdison announced the change to its board, its stock had closed at $3.05.

In that same letter last summer, Mr. Einhorn urged investors to sit tight and signed off with a quote from the inventor Thomas A. Edison: “A diamond is a piece of coal that stuck to the job.”

A veteran in the hedge fund industry, Ms. Gogel worked for Discovery Technology Fund, and founded a long-short equity hedge fund called Perennial Advisors. She left Greenlight Capital at the end of 2014 “to pursue other interests and spend more time with her family,” Mr. Einhorn wrote to investors at the time.

Mr. Einhorn and Greenlight Capital have had seats on the boards of other companies and he is currently chairman of the board at Green Brick Partners, a real estate operator. But he is perhaps best known for his battle against New Century Financial, the mortgage company. In 2006, after threatening to wage a proxy war and oust three directors from New Century Financial, the company made him a director.

One year later, as the subprime market was imploding and New Century’s stock was plunging, Mr. Einhorn resigned from the lender’s board five days after it disclosed that federal authorities had opened a criminal probe looking into accounting irregularities. A month later the company filed for bankruptcy.

The event is referred to as a week, but spans four days. Emerging designers and mass-market fashion labels alike will present fall 2016 collections as runway shows, standing presentations and “multimedia experiences.”

In attendance will be journalists, celebrities, department store buyers and fashion directors. Also present: men who swan about in preposterous outfits to attract the attention of the photographers clustered outside the show sites.

Its 58 works on canvas and paper also attest to the Modern’s laserlike focus on accounting fully for the achievements of artists it deems great. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)

★ Museum of Modern Art: ‘Joaquín Torres-García: The Arcadian Modern’ (through Feb. 15) Few artists can claim to have captured a revolution in thinking in a single image, but Joaquín Torres-García did. In 1934, Torres-Garcia (1874-1949) took a hard-won knowledge of European modernism from Paris back to his birthplace of Uruguay. He gave the transplanted movement a name — “The School of the South” — and designed for it a now-famous logo: the silhouette of the South American continent turned upside down and placed above the Tropic of Cancer, where North America was on conventional maps. And he explained the meaning: The South, as a font of creative energy, was the new North, or at least its equal. The image, and the spirit that produced it, can be found in MoMA’s career survey, the artist’s first major United States retrospective in four decades. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)

Museum of Modern Art: ‘Ocean of Images: New Photography 2015’ (through March 20) To celebrate the 30th anniversary of its longstanding “New Photography” series, and perhaps to soften the news that the series will now change from annual to biennial, MoMA presents the largest and most cosmopolitan edition yet, with 19 artists and collectives, from 14 countries. The title refers to the infinite image blank called the Internet, and borrowed and manipulated images. So built-in delays in accessibility. Almost wherever you look you need to look twice, and consult a label, to fully understand what you’re seeing. The extra effort feels more fruitful in some cases than in others, with work by Yuki Kimura, Basim Magdy, Indre Serpytyte and Lieko Shiga particular worth lingering over. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)

★ Museum of Modern Art: ‘Picasso Sculpture’ (through Feb. 7) Nearly a work of art in its own right, this magnificent show redefines Picasso’s achievement with the first full view here in 50 years of his astoundingly varied forays into sculpture. His materials, not his female loves, become the muses, and are different each time out. The basic plotline: After introducing sculptural abstraction and space, he spent about 50 years counting the ways that the figure was far from finished. 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)

Museum of Modern Art: ‘Scenes for a New Heritage: Contemporary Art from the Collection’ (through April 10) MoMA’s latest installation of works from its permanent collection fills the second-floor contemporary galleries with videos, installations, sculptures, drawings, prints and photographs produced by more than 30 artists during the past three decades. It’s an uneven, haphazard selection, but leaving artistic quality aside, its unusually optimistic-sounding title inadvertently raises a large and intriguing question: At a time when contemporary art seems to be spinning its wheels, what could a new heritage be? 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)

★ Museum of Modern Art: ‘Soldier, Spectre, Shaman: The Figure and the Second World War’ (through March 20) MoMA usually stages the years after 1945 as a triumph of American abstraction, but this vital show affirms that the human figure never disappeared from art — especially not in battle-scarred Europe. With the end of the war, and the full revelation of the Holocaust, the human body became a sign of pathos and existential dread, notably in the fraught paintings of Francis Bacon and the spindly sculptures of Alberto Giacometti. The same was true of other European artists who received less American acclaim — such as Jean Fautrier, whose haunted “Otages” (“Hostages”) are far better known in his native France. The show is drawn entirely from the museum’s permanent collection, and its greatest surprise comes from Jan Müller, a German émigré in New York, whose ghoulish “Faust I” (1956) depicts the witches of Goethe’s epic as starved, traumatized wraiths. 212-708-9400, moma.org.

Production of this fuel is more complex and costly and requires significant upfront investments.

If we could start again from zero, a performance-based standard would produce better results. Setting the standard based on how clean the fuel should be would give companies the flexibility to figure out how to reach the target.

This is already being done in California and Oregon, which have performance-based fuel standards. The California program, for instance, requires fuel producers to reduce greenhouse gas pollution by 10 percent in transportation fuels in 2020. Because it is technology neutral, and interested only in the result, this approach supports investments in the cleanest fuels while providing maximum flexibility to the industry to develop them.

Still, the existing federal fuel standard, as imperfect as it may be, is now an essential component of our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow climate change.

To move forward, the E.P.A. should phase in the fuel standard mandate in a predictable way to provide a growing market for advanced and cellulosic renewable fuels. We also need to shift tax policy for cellulosic fuels to support long-term investment similar to the tax policies for wind and solar power. And we need several more states to adopt performance-based standards, and to support investment to encourage the development of the next generation of renewable fuels.

The United States needs to reduce carbon pollution from cars and trucks by 80 percent by 2050. Advances in propulsion technology alone will not be enough to meet that goal. Passenger cars will have to not only go farther on less fuel, but also travel those miles on lower-carbon fuel.

As the candidates continue their quest for the White House, the question should not be, as it was in Iowa, “Do you support the renewable fuel standard?” but “How do we move to the next generation of renewable fuels?” We must demand an approach that spurs innovation and makes steady progress on lower-carbon fuels.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/opinion/the-problem-with-the-ethanol-mandate-that-iowa-loves.html

While Ms. Holmes has expressed confidence in Theranos’s ability to get approval for its methods and the tests it plans to offer, the company must wait for the F.D.A. to weigh in.

It’s a familiar way of donating, mastered by the Red Cross during global catastrophes: Simply text a five-digit number and a donation is made seamlessly through a phone bill.

And now the method is coming to the Sanders campaign. Through the campaign’s digital vendor, Revolution Messaging, supporters of Mr. Sanders can now text the word “Give” to a special number and automatically donate $10.

There are federal caps to the donations that users can send. Individual phone numbers are allowed to donate $50 a month, topping out at $200 a year.

But the Sanders digital team believes that the limits won’t affect them, pointing to their large universe of small-dollar donors that have been powering their campaign. The current average donation is $27.

“By putting the power in the hands of the ordinary citizens that text in 10 bucks, instead of billionaires wasting time and money at cocktail parties, we are changing the campaign finance playbook with Bernie Sanders and his supporters,” Scott Goodstein, the chief executive of Revolution Messaging, said in a statement.

The Sanders campaign had been experimenting with text-to-donate applications before. It recently started a program integrated with ActBlue, but that only works for mobile subscribers who are also signed up with ActBlue Express, and it bills a credit card. This new technology can be used by anyone with a cellphone.

Texting has struggled to catch on in political campaigns as a money source, but it has never had the ease of donations that this new technology brings.

The method has been extremely successful for groups like the Red Cross to raise huge sums of money quickly.

Politically, I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed — unless the revolution you have in mind involves putting Donald Trump’s finger on the button. But an environmental/energy revolution? That’s looking remarkably within reach.

Joe Romm has the story. The backdrop is the remarkable progress of recent years in renewable-energy technologies, which have put solar and wind power in striking distance of matching the costs of electricity generation using fossil fuels. There are two remaining hurdles: the costs aren’t quite there, and renewables have a hard time matching fluctuations in demand.

Enter three policy changes. First, the last budget deal retained tax incentives for renewables, which will have a huge impact — maybe even a DT yuge impact — on their deployment over the next decade. Second, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge by power companies to EPA rules leading to “demand response” pricing — basically, paying people not to consume electricity during peak periods, which helps renewables a lot. Finally, if Democrats hold the White House we’ll have the Obama administration’s plan to limit carbon going into effect, creating a big incentive to switch to renewables.

Nothing in this should lead to complacency. We’re still facing a huge climate challenge, and President Trump (or for that matter any of the seven dwarfs from last night) could and would destroy the whole thing.

He never raises his voice in this easy-listening jeremiad.","['chomskys', 'mr', 'theres', 'american', 'noam', 'focuses', 'sanders', 'writer', 'chomsky', 'inequality', 'financial', 'review', 'dream', 'win', 'power', 'requiem', 'say']","“Requiem for the American Dream” is a timely 75-minute teach-in by Noam Chomsky, the M.I.T. linguistics professor who has been a leading leftist political analyst, critic and writer for six decades. Mr. Chomsky, already the subject of several documentaries, focuses here on an election-season theme: financial inequality in America and what he calls its corrosive effect on democracy. Assembling “10 Principles of Concentration of Wealth and Power,” he lays out rules like “Run the Regulators,” “Marginalize the Population” and “Manufacture Consent.”

None of these perspectives are new to, say, the Bernie Sanders campaign staff (though they might be startled by Mr. Chomsky’s opinion that Mr. Sanders “doesn’t have much of a chance” to win). But citing Aristotle, Adam Smith and James Madison, among others, he melds history, philosophy and ideology into a sobering vision of a society in an accelerating decline. He never raises his voice in this easy-listening jeremiad. “There’s nothing surprising about this,” he repeats gently in describing what he sees as a 40-year trend of government bent to the will of the superrich at the expense of everyone else. “That’s what happens when you put power in the hands of a narrow sector.”

The film’s opening titles say these constitute Mr. Chomsky’s “final long-form documentary interviews,” but this well-paced and cogent seminar spotlights a man who, now 87, seems at the height of his intellectual powers. Still, the film, directed by Peter Hutchison, Kelly Nyks and Jared P. Scott, is called “Requiem” for a reason: Mr. Chomsky concludes that “there’s a lot that can be done if people organize, struggle for their rights as they’ve done in the past.” You get the feeling, though, that, given all the challenges he lists, Mr. Chomsky no longer quite believes that.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/movies/review-noam-chomsky-focuses-on-financial-inequality.html

Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy’s “A Girl in the River: The Price of Forgiveness” is an enlightening exploration of the Pakistani culture that allows and even encourages honor killing. In this account of an 18-year-old woman who disobeys her family by eloping with a man from a lower class without permission, she is shot in the face by her father and uncle, thrown into a river and left to drown. Miraculously she survives. All the principals are interviewed.

Two films temper horrifying images with stories of courage and nobility. “Chau, Beyond the Lines,” directed by Courtney Marsh and produced by Jerry Franck, observes the patients in a Vietnamese care center for children born with birth defects from Agent Orange. The title character is an optimistic teenager who has learned to paint holding the brush in his mouth. His dream is to become a professional artist and clothing designer. The Liberian film “Body Team 12,” directed by David Darg and produced with Bryn Mooser, focuses on the female member of a medical team whose job is to dispose of bodies after the 2014 Ebola outbreak.

“Last Day of Freedom,” the most idiosyncratic and moving documentary, rendered in black-and-white line drawing, is the agonizing story of Manny Babbitt, an African-American who suffered brain damage in a childhood accident and later committed a capital crime after serving in Vietnam and returning to his home in Sacramento, Calif., with post-traumatic stress disorder. As directed by Dee Hibbert-Jones and Nomi Talisman, Mr. Babbitt’s story is told by his brother Bill, who had to decide whether to cover for his brother or turn him in. It will break your heart.

478,Annuities as an Alternative to Shaky Markets? Not So Fast,2016-01-30,['Christopher Farrell'],"The model they developed suggests that annuitization is a risky strategy once health care shocks for the elderly are taken into account.
“Most Americans in our model should not annuitize,” Professor Smetters said.
Social Security is an inflation-adjusted creditworthy annuity far superior to anything offered in the marketplace.
Working longer, even earning a part-time income, makes it easier to delay filing for Social Security benefits until age 70.
“Social Security is an awesome annuity,” Professor Smetters said.","['age', 'annuities', 'retirement', 'savings', 'security', 'markets', 'care', 'smetters', 'social', 'annuity', 'alternative', 'health', 'shaky', 'professor', 'fast']","Moreover, buyers should be wary of tying up all their savings in an annuity. Besides the risk of outliving your investments, “other risks may be more serious,” Arnold Kling, entrepreneur, economist and teacher, writes on his blog. “You could easily find yourself needing to take out a loan if your savings are tied up in an annuity and your spouse requires a home health aide.”

Felix Reichling of the Congressional Budget Office and Kent Smetters at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania researched that insight. The model they developed suggests that annuitization is a risky strategy once health care shocks for the elderly are taken into account.

Fidelity estimates that on average a couple, both age 65 and who retired in 2015, can expect to spend an estimated $245,000 on health care during their retirement. Fidelity’s figure does not include nursing home and long-term care expenses.

“Most Americans in our model should not annuitize,” Professor Smetters said. He does recommend considering annuities if you have at least $500,000 set aside first, half for medical expenses and half to tap when needed. His financial rule of thumb eliminates most boomers.

The median balance for people age 65 to 74 with retirement savings in 2010 was $138,000 for married households and $49,000 for single households, according to Professor Poterba of M.I.T. The comparable numbers for those age 55 to 64 is $130,000 married and $45,000 single.

“Certainly, there is the dynamic that people who can afford a significant allocation to annuities don’t need to,” says Michael Kitces, a certified financial planner and director of research at Pinnacle Advisory Group. “The rest can’t really annuitize all their wealth.”

What are the alternatives? Social Security is an inflation-adjusted creditworthy annuity far superior to anything offered in the marketplace. Working longer, even earning a part-time income, makes it easier to delay filing for Social Security benefits until age 70. Waiting will produce real returns of 4 , 5 or even 6 percent a year for those living to age 90 and more. “Social Security is an awesome annuity,” Professor Smetters said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/30/your-money/annuities-as-an-alternative-to-shaky-markets-not-so-fast.html

Fidelity estimates that on average a couple, both age 65 and who retired in 2015, can expect to spend an estimated $245,000 on health care during their retirement. Fidelity’s figure does not include nursing home and long-term care expenses.

“Most Americans in our model should not annuitize,” Professor Smetters said. He does recommend considering annuities if you have at least $500,000 set aside first, half for medical expenses and half to tap when needed. His financial rule of thumb eliminates most boomers.

The median balance for people age 65 to 74 with retirement savings in 2010 was $138,000 for married households and $49,000 for single households, according to Professor Poterba of M.I.T. The comparable numbers for those age 55 to 64 is $130,000 married and $45,000 single.

“Certainly, there is the dynamic that people who can afford a significant allocation to annuities don’t need to,” says Michael Kitces, a certified financial planner and director of research at Pinnacle Advisory Group. “The rest can’t really annuitize all their wealth.”

What are the alternatives? Social Security is an inflation-adjusted creditworthy annuity far superior to anything offered in the marketplace. Working longer, even earning a part-time income, makes it easier to delay filing for Social Security benefits until age 70. Waiting will produce real returns of 4 , 5 or even 6 percent a year for those living to age 90 and more. “Social Security is an awesome annuity,” Professor Smetters said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/30/your-money/annuities-as-an-alternative-to-shaky-markets-not-so-fast.html

Four years later, I became C.E.O. When the board approved my new role, it just hit me like a ton of bricks that this is really happening.

What do you like about being C.E.O.?

I like to put all the pieces together. It’s like a Rubik’s Cube. When you’re running a start-up, you have this finite set of resources, and you have this huge goal. So you look at all the angles, and twist things this way and that as you’re thinking, “What if we did it this way?”

Any surprises in the role?

I’ve had light-bulb moments when I realized I have to be really thoughtful about what I ask for and how I ask for it, because people are watching and listening closely, and caring in a way that they didn’t when I didn’t have this title. That’s always been a little bit uncomfortable for me. I don’t have this grand image of myself. I’m just like everybody else.

How do you hire?

With some people, I’ll ask questions like, “When nobody is watching you, outside of work, what do you do to be great that is only for you and that no one else will ever see?” I’m just looking for that internal drive.

I’ll also ask people to tell me about times when they have been on a path to failure, and what their mental dialogue was to reset that. Because I want to understand their psychology a little bit. How do you give yourself a pep talk? What do you say to yourself? What are the games you play in your head to right things?

No longer the purview of airports, lickety-split beauty and wellness treatments are augmenting the traditional spa menus at hotels and resorts. In the wake of the 2008 recession, many spas began offering shorter treatments for consumers who could no longer afford to indulge: Some 75 percent of spas added abbreviated treatments to their menus, according to the International Spa Association. The trend stuck, and appears to be taking on renewed significance at a time when beauty and wellness-on-demand apps like Glamsquad and Zeel allow people to book and receive massages, manicures, makeup applications and blowouts wherever they are — an Airbnb rental, an office building — with a few taps on a smartphone.

Among the nascent players is JW Marriott Hotels and Resorts. The upscale chain is rolling out its Spa by JW concept with treatments that last 12 to 25 minutes and can be booked without an appointment. Treatments include scalp massages, shoulder massages and hand exfoliation and moisturizing, and are offered in chairs tricked out with scent infusers, noise canceling technology and smartphone charging stations. “It gives our travelers who honestly don’t have the time to do the full spa treatment the ability to refresh or calm down after a flight,” said Mitzi Gaskins, Marriott International’s vice president of luxury brand management.

So far, Spa by JW is in a couple of hotels, including the new JW Marriott Houston Downtown and the JW Marriott Mumbai Sahar in India; some 25 spas are in the pipeline. Ms. Gaskins said the concept grew out of Marriott’s research, which included talking to avid spagoers around the world as well as guests who don’t usually frequent hotel spas. Some felt intimidated by the typical spa setup, which often includes a secluded location within a hotel, a seemingly aloof reception desk staff and undressing and putting on a robe. Spa by JW is designed to be in a busy area of a hotel; a kind of additional lounge for guests that also offers quick pick-me-up treatments that can be booked on a whim rather than reserved a week before.

He has not granted himself a job title featuring the word “guru” or “maven.” Partly for these reasons and partly because his diagnoses rang true, I bought in to “Deep Work.” Six ­pages in, I powered down my laptop. Twenty pages in, I left the house to buy an alarm clock so that I wouldn’t have an excuse to sleep next to my phone. A hundred ­pages in, I asked my brother to change my Twitter password so that I could no longer log in to my account. Nothing like starting the new year off with a renunciatory spree!

The best way to evaluate a physician is to determine whether state-of-the-art medical practices are followed.
Similarly, a better way to judge presidents is by the policies they pursue, not the outcomes over which they preside.
Looking ahead, judging presidents by policies rather than outcomes may be all the more important.

Consider how you would assess a physician whom you could observe treating only a single patient. A terrible way to judge the doctor is by whether the patient lives or dies. After all, even the best physicians have patients who die when their illnesses are severe. And given the natural restorative powers of the human body, even a quack can have a patient who returns to good health.

The best way to evaluate a physician is to determine whether state-of-the-art medical practices are followed. A doctor who prescribes the right antibiotics gets high marks, while one who prescribes snake oil gets a failing grade.

Similarly, a better way to judge presidents is by the policies they pursue, not the outcomes over which they preside. This task is harder than merely looking at unemployment, inflation and the growth of gross domestic product. It requires having a view about what policies are best at fostering prosperity and acknowledging that the experts are often divided on that question.

Looking ahead, judging presidents by policies rather than outcomes may be all the more important. In a new book, “The Rise and Fall of American Growth,” the economist Robert Gordon argues that we are in the midst of an era of meager technological change. Yes, we now have smartphones and Twitter, but previous generations introduced electric lighting, indoor plumbing and the internal combustion engine. In Mr. Gordon’s view, technological change is just not what it used to be, and we had better get used to slower growth in productivity and incomes.

I have no idea whether Mr. Gordon’s pessimism is justified. In light of economists’ abysmal track record of long-term forecasting, all such prognostications should be taken with a shaker of salt.

But if Mr. Gordon turns out to be right, future presidents will operate in a more difficult economic environment than many of their predecessors. Because the pace of scientific and technological advance has a life of its own, slow productivity growth may be a problem without a solution.

Particularly in this environment, judging presidents based on outcomes rather than policies is an egregious error. We would end up blaming them for results over which they have little control. We would find ourselves disappointed in our leaders, even if they are doing the best they can. Instead of supporting sound policies, we might cast our votes out of a frustration that is not fully rational.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/upshot/to-grade-presidents-on-the-economy-look-at-policies-not-results.html

First came the Great Inventions, almost all dating from the late 19th century.
Then came refinement and exploitation of those inventions — a process that took time, and exerted its peak effect on economic growth between 1920 and 1970.
Everything since has at best been a faint echo of that great wave, and Gordon doesn’t expect us ever to see anything similar.
What happened between 1870 and 1940, he argues, and I would agree, is what real transformation looks like.","['fall', 'book', 'transformation', 'krugman', 'reviews', 'real', 'growth', 'gordon', 'american', 'paul', 'important', 'great', 'rise', 'robert', 'inventions', 'replaced', 'economic', 'j']","In “The Rise and Fall of American Growth,” Gordon doubles down on that theme, declaring that the kind of rapid economic growth we still consider our due, and expect to continue forever, was in fact a one-time-only event.

Everything since has at best been a faint echo of that great wave, and Gordon doesn’t expect us ever to see anything similar.

Is he right? My answer is a definite maybe. But whether or not you end up agreeing with Gordon’s thesis, this is a book well worth reading — a magisterial combination of deep technological history, vivid portraits of daily life over the past six generations and careful economic analysis. Non-economists may find some of the charts and tables heavy going, but Gordon never loses sight of the real people and real lives behind those charts. This book will challenge your views about the future; it will definitely transform how you see the past.

Indeed, almost half the book is devoted to changes that took place before World War II. Others have covered this ground — most notably Daniel Boorstin in “The Americans: The Democratic Experience.” Even knowing this literature, however, I was fascinated by Gordon’s account of the changes wrought by his Great Inventions. As he says, “Except in the rural South, daily life for every American changed beyond recognition between 1870 and 1940.” Electric lights replaced candles and whale oil, flush toilets replaced outhouses, cars and electric trains replaced horses. (In the 1880s, parts of New York’s financial district were seven feet deep in manure.)

Meanwhile, backbreaking toil both in the workplace and in the home was for the most part replaced by far less onerous employment. This is a point all too often missed by economists, who tend to think only about how much purchasing power people have, not about what they have to do to get it, and Gordon does an important service by reminding us that the conditions under which men and women labor are as important as the amount they get paid.

Image Robert J. Gordon in 2015.

Aside from its being an interesting story, however, why is it important to study this transformation? Mainly, Gordon suggests — although these are my words, not his — to provide a baseline. What happened between 1870 and 1940, he argues, and I would agree, is what real transformation looks like. Any claims about current progress need to be compared with that baseline to see how they measure up.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/books/review/the-powers-that-were.html

Josh Gotbaum, a scholar at the Brookings Institution and the former C.E.O. of the September 11th Fund, heard a screeching sound as the traction motors lost their grip. Beth Davidz, then a media technologist with the news site BillyPenn, saw the lights go dim and thought, This is not an ordinary bump. Vallen Graham, a research associate at Rockefeller University, was ejected from his seat and into the seat back in front of him, bruising his ribs.

Seyward Darby was reaching out to brace herself when Car 3, like Car 4 behind it and Car 2 ahead, landed on its right side. She had no time to think about Justin Zemser in the seat next to her — she had no time to think about anything. Without warning, she was airborne, and dirt was entering the coach in a great cloud. Hours later, at the hospital, she would still be scrubbing it from her face. She came to rest on her back, on the right side of the train, which was now the bottom of the train. Above her, she could see the windows that had once faced west. She did a quick inventory: Her limbs seemed to work. She wasn’t bleeding badly.

A few feet away, invisible to Darby in the smoke and dust, Graham was trying to get the other passengers organized. “If you have flashlights on your phone, please turn them on,” he shouted. Graham didn’t know a whole lot about trains, but he did know that trains like 188 ran on electric currents — the last thing anyone needed was to run into a live wire. Graham reached over to help up the passenger closest to him. “My head hurts,” the man said, and he ran a blood-smeared hand across a deep gash on his forehead.

They needed an escape route. The best exit looked to be the left-facing windows. Graham scrambled on top of a pile of broken seats and pulled out one of the panes. As the air turned smoky, Graham and Gotbaum worked together to evacuate as many passengers as they could, with Gotbaum supporting the passengers’ backs or bottoms and Graham hauling them upward from the lip of the window. It was an assembly line: one passenger, two passengers, three passengers — maybe eight in all, Darby among them.

Gotbaum made one more pass through the car, stopping in front of a woman who appeared to have been crushed by a loose seat. She was not moving. One of her legs protruded from the wreckage at a bizarre angle. There was nothing more that Gotbaum could do. The smoke was thickening; visibility was almost nil; his lungs were stinging. He headed for the window.

It is unlikely that even had he known to look for Justin Zemser, Gotbaum would have found him. According to a lawsuit filed by the Zemser family, Justin was launched from the train car as it overturned. His injuries included skull, sternum and spine fractures; cardiac lacerations; and a punctured aorta. A seat over, Darby would emerge with scrapes and bruises. Two bodies in motion, they followed radically different trajectories, governed by physics and maybe fate — Darby landing in a heap inside the train and Zemser ejected from it.

But these problems aren’t insurmountable — if we connect the social mindset of young workers to the power of technology.

We now live in the age of digitization. Connected technologies can monitor everything from our bodies and cars to factories and businesses. Unprecedented amounts of data are being collected and analyzed to solve real-world problems as personal as asthma attacks and as complicated as car accidents, pipeline ruptures and supply chain breakdowns. This is happening today. And it’s only the beginning. At the same time, the world faces a growing litany of complicated challenges. There are doubts that enough water and food can be distributed to growing populations. Job creation appears insufficient to narrow the widening gap between the rich and poor, further driving social and political instability. These are just a few of the known problems today. While the challenges may seem insurmountable, there are reasons for optimism. The Internet of Things and other technologies that link people, data and devices can provide the tools for confronting economic inefficiency, climate change and more. Companies are also more focused on the issues beyond the bottom line, and a new generation of workers is ready to take action. With the confluence of grand global problems and digital transformation, the world needs individuals who not only have the desire to make the world better but also the knowledge and skills to do so. A new generation of problem solvers must be discovered, prepared and engaged.

Positioning for the Future Never before have people and companies been so motivated to help the world. A growing number of today’s new workers believes that work and social responsibility go hand in hand. In fact, a global survey of 8,000 people by MSLGROUP found that many millennials expect employers to address the myriad global problems facing the planet today. A large majority of respondents — 82 percent — believe that business has at least as much potential as government to solve society’s problems.

Companies, meanwhile, are moving in the same direction as CEOs are demanding more sustainable and socially conscious practices. “Everyone’s making an effort to do a little bit more,” says Allie Williams, executive director of the Corporate Responsibility Association. That’s a change from a generation ago, when most people and companies were concerned about themselves and their profits. “People are much more connected to each other today,” says Anita McGahan, a professor of strategic management at Toronto’s Rotman School of Management. Education — the key connection of young people to their careers and the future — is also changing. Today, professors are teaching students to solve problems, become social entrepreneurs and to think critically. “We can’t afford to simply teach our students how to advertise toys and bubble gum,” McGahan says. “Social consciousness and social entrepreneurship are at the heart of the biggest business opportunities for this century.” But traditional education may not be evolving fast enough to keep pace with either technology or global problems. In one survey by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, 39 percent of employers said they could not fill vacant entry-level positions because candidates didn’t have the right skills, while 72 percent of educators believe their students are prepared for the job market. This disconnect is happening as the world grapples with unemployment. The International Labour Organization says more than 200 million people are without jobs — a number that is expected to climb another 11 million by 2020. Of those, 74 million are youth. The McKinsey study traces the problem to the fact that major stakeholders are not engaging with each other. A third of companies say they never work with educators. Of those who do, fewer than half said the communication was effective. Meanwhile, fewer than half of the youth surveyed said they had an understanding of what to study for a profession with openings and decent wages.

Empowering People through Technology

Billions of connected sensors and other devices are collecting unprecedented amounts of data that can be analyzed and acted upon by people or computers. The Internet of Things, the connection of people, data, and processes, is transforming how we do everything. Patients wearing connected watches can send their heart rates to their doctors; sensors on store shelves can tell store managers when to restock; cars can now tell you when you get too close to a car or that you’re steering the wrong way. Every industry will operate differently in the future than it does today. To work with such rapidly evolving technologies, students need to learn how to solve problems that they don’t even know exist yet. This technology will only become more powerful in the future. People will be able to predict when they’re about to have a heart attack, sensors will be able to monitor minute changes in global temperatures, devices will stop pipeline leaks or bridge collapses before they happen and much more. There is no question IoT will play an important role in solving global problems. Even today, it’s being used on smaller-scale global challenges such as clean water and agriculture. The not-for-profit organization Living Goods, for instance, deploys a small army of door-to-door entrepreneurs to villages in Uganda and Kenya to dispense drugs and advice on improving health and generating wealth. All transactions are done through a basic smartphone, which serves a tool for collecting health data and distributing information to people in need. In areas where it operates, Living Goods has reduced childhood mortality by more than 25 percent, while also pushing drug prices down 17 percent and cutting in half the prevalence of counterfeit drugs. “What's the most powerful tool in their bag?” asks Living Goods CEO Chuck Slaughter. “A simple, feature-free mobile phone.” Sensors are also being put to use to help some of the 800 million people — or one-ninth of the world’s population — who don’t have access to clean water. The international development organization Water for People uses the technology to collect and analyze data in India, Bolivia, Uganda and other clean water-starved nations. Thanks to its work, nearly 200,000 people gained access to improved water in 2014. The Internet of Things is also beginning to help address hunger in a world where roughly 805 million people consume less than the recommended 2,100 calories per day. In Africa, a network of inexpensive sensors was installed for a small farming community. Radio towers built by the Hershey Company collected the data, which was analyzed by sophisticated software that told the farmers when and where to plant their crops to maximize the yield. “The farmers made money and in turn that made their community stronger and more vibrant,” says Williams of the Corporate Responsibility Association. “A great deal of education was needed to use the technology, but that resulted in more meaningful decisions and more meaningful ways for people to do things.” Maximizing the benefits of IoT on a global scale will require skills that traditional educational institutions haven’t traditionally taught in the past. Workers will need a breadth of knowledge across a number of high-tech fields, including data analytics, security, programming and infrastructure management. They also need to be creative and innovative — and for some entrepreneurial. By 2020, IoT is expected to become a $19 trillion industry with 26 billion interconnected devices, according to Cisco Systems. It has the potential to be a powerful tool for solving global problems — or a major missed opportunity if there are not enough workers to support it.

Educating a New Generation of Problem Solvers While many businesses are focused on social change, Cisco is combining technology and education with the goal of creating a pipeline of global thinkers to tackle the future’s most difficult challenges. The networking pioneer has been educating workers since 1997, when it started the Cisco Networking Academy, as a set of courses and certificate programs. Today, the Networking Academy partners with more than 9,500 institutions that teach one million students each year in over 170 countries. Between 2005 and 2014, more than 1.3 million students have started new jobs as a result of the program. The Networking Academy is about far more than helping workers fix network problems — it’s giving people the chance to be on technology’s cutting edge and to contribute to society and business in more meaningful ways. Students learn from instructors with diverse backgrounds and do hands-on work that can be applied in real-life and unexpected situations. “You can’t anticipate everything,” says Amanda Cumberland, a research and evaluation specialist with Cisco. “If you teach someone a coding language, for instance, then that could become obsolete. But teach them how to think about coding and to understand the principles of it and they can apply it to whatever new skill is coming out.” As many skills as people learn at the Networking Academy, it’s the program’s focus on problem solving that’s benefiting these future leaders the most. The world is changing so quickly that today’s workers will have to be able to think quickly and creatively. “We are harnessing the power of technology to launch a generation of problem solvers,” says Tae Yoo, senior vice president of corporate affairs at Cisco. “They are being taught to innovate like technologists, think like entrepreneurs and act as social change agents.”",https://www.nytimes.com/paidpost/cisco/developing-a-new-generation-of-global-problem-solvers.html

Watch the video below.

Today, the Swedish capital is among the fastest-growing urban centers in Europe, with a population that’s expected to grow 11 percent to more than 1 million by 2020. It’s also a major exporter of technology, with 22,000 tech startups alone. The birthplace of Skype, Minecraft and Spotify, it has more “unicorns” per capita — startups valued over $1 billion — than any other region outside California’s Silicon Valley.

The city of Stockholm , spread over 14 islands on the northern edge of Europe, realized long ago that its future depended on planning ahead not just to survive long winters but also to break through its isolation to forge connections to the rest of the world. This mindset of thoughtful planning continues to return rewards.

The Stockholm metropolitan area ranked No. 9 among the 50 regions surveyed as part of the Dell Future Ready Economies Model, with higher-than-average scores in the three categories of human capital, commerce and infrastructure.

Planning and investment in education, urban development and technology have created an environment that’s attracting new people, ideas and businesses. It’s a virtuous cycle that’s a common theme among the world’s future-ready economies.

“Stockholm is the kind of city that we really like to point out,” said Jim Diffley, senior director at HIS, which partnered with Dell to develop the rankings. “You could compare them to Silicon Valley and that type of environment. They don't get the big splashy press because of where they're located, but they have been quietly making a lot of investment and being progressive.”

One area of investment is education, where teachers and school officials are investing time and money to understand what tools are the most effective, said Suss Forssman Thullberg, former head of communications at the Swedish Agency for School Improvement.

“We have a strong tradition in Sweden of innovative education,” she says. “It has taken a long time to really find out from the teacher’s perspective what are the tools that really make a difference.”

At the Viktor Rydbergs School, for example, students are using the popular world-building game Minecraft to learn how to collaborate and build. ”They’re actually learning to understand each other and each other’s differences,” says Stina Afsenius, a teacher at the school. “It’s important to include technology.”

Stockholm also invested early and aggressively in the Internet. In 1994, the Swedish government announced that it would create a fiber-optic network spanning its capital city. The network now includes enough fiber to wrap around the globe 30 times. All businesses and 90 percent of homes are connected, and about 94 percent of schoolchildren have access to the Internet at school.

“They realized, very early on, what impact it could have on the city,” said Niklas Agevik, chief executive of Instabridge, the world’s largest crowdsourced Wi-Fi network. “Growing up in Stockholm had a huge impact on my view of technology, from having fun with it to what I’m doing today — building a company out of it.”",https://www.nytimes.com/paidpost/dell/future-ready-economies/stockholm-a-future-rooted-in-careful-planning.html

The people — and things — that push photographers to capture the best images. INSPIRATION TAKES MANY FORMS for a photographer. It can come from what they are shooting to what’s around them — or even the lighting at a certain time of day. That spark can also come from a spouse or sibling, who, in working closely with one another, can push their vision further than what they thought possible in order to create that perfect image. The following photographers tell us how they began their journeys, and what, or who, drives their work to ever more impressive levels of artistry.

Floto+Warner When Jeremy Floto met Cassandra Warner at the Rochester Institute of Technology's photography school, there was immediate chemistry in front of and behind the lens. ""It was fast,"" Warner remembers. ""We were shooting on the same camera and we couldn’t tell whose photos were whose."" That similarity of style, coupled with a professional competitiveness to ""get the shot,"" has resulted in an artistic collaboration whose design-infused photography often contains surprising visual metaphors. Floto grew up outside of Nevada and meandered through jobs as a ski patrolman and paramedic before finding his calling in photography and design. ""For me, it grew out of a love for things that visually excited me in nature,"" Floto says. Warner grew up in upstate New York and, like Floto, took a “long road” to photography. Together, they discovered a new perspective on subjects that excited both. They honed their style by taking pictures of the “suburban abandoned strip malls” and the “bleak, desolate landscape” surrounding RIT, Warner says.

""It was new for me because I grew up out West; and for Cassandra it was something that was deeply personal,"" Floto says. ""I think that combined vision is one of the great things about working together — even though we've crafted an aesthetic vision together, the reasons behind our interest in certain subjects is different. There's a synergy to the way we work and we both bring our own perspective."" The married pair’s differing perspectives combine to create a cohesive vision that art lovers and clients are innately drawn to. ""We get to go places that people don’t have a chance to go. There is something that’s great about being able to translate that visual drama into something for people to look at,"" Floto says. While working together can create a cohesive vision, it can also spur creativity when there is a mental block. ""Sometimes you don’t see 'it' but one person does, and you can feed off of that energy and push each other,"" Warner says. Working as a team allows Floto+Warner to pursue what they love, together. ""We love to travel, and we get to enjoy each other's company when we go to shoot,"" she says.

Matt Borowick and Nancy Borowick It wasn't hard for Matt Borowick to find a path to photography — his sister, Nancy, had already paved the way for him as an award-winning photographer herself. ""Photography was something our older sister did in high school, and so I did it, and Matty followed,"" says Nancy Borowick, three years Matt’s senior. While Nancy may have guided him there, Matt quickly found his own style of photography before joining his sister in a wedding photography business. During an event, Nancy will take the lead and take primary photography of family and guests. Meanwhile, Matt canvases the space for striking landscape shots and hidden details, exploring the world using a detailed combination of macro- and micro-environments that reveal a unique style. Matt will often walk away from the ceremony or reception and find a location that can truly define the ethereal feel of the evening. Using long-exposure shots, Matt’s photography can capture the seemingly infinite stars in the night sky or a vast, mountainous landscape surrounding a valley. Or, just as easily, he has the ability to show you the minute detail and delicate beauty of engraved jewelry or blossoming flowers. For Nancy, wedding photography is a stark departure from her previous project, which was documenting the life-ending cancer diagnoses of their mother, and soon after, their father. Her wedding during this time was the one bright spot from the cloud that weighed over the family for those two years. ""It allowed us to think about something else,"" says Nancy. Following the passing of their parents, the siblings turned to weddings to rediscover their passion for photography.















""I needed something that I could find great joy in photographing,"" Nancy says. The first wedding they shot was just for fun, but Nancy realized how happy it made her, and a business was born. For Matt, the feeling that he gets at weddings is one that doesn't compare with any other kind of photography. ""Whenever I leave weddings, I feel refreshed, happy, joyous — and so exhausted,"" he says. The brother-sister combination is one that has proven to be an asset in the world of wedding photography. It allows for each partner to honestly critique the other’s work and push them further as an artist. Plus, it’s never lonely. ""It’s nice because often in this business you are a lone wolf — it's nice to have a pack,"" says Matt. ""People see that we're family, and view us as an extended part of their family,"" Nancy says.

Ralph Smith Sometimes it's working with a partner that brings out an artist’s creative side. Other times it's the solitude of nature that allows one to see things in a way others don’t. The wide-open vistas of the Scottish Highlands is one muse for Ralph Smith, who uses his photographs of high, open valleys as a starting point to craft his hyper-colored images that conjure thoughts of barren interplanetary landscapes. ""I'm inspired by the sublime,"" he says. ""If you can find that scene that is horrific and humbling simultaneously — it is a personal experience — but I think it can be conveyed in a photograph,"" Smith says. Smith's drive was sparked by his high school photography teacher. After graduation, that passion led to an internship with famed photographer Arnold Newman and, later, a degree from the Rochester Institute of Technology for photography. While starting his professional career in studio still life, Smith thought back to his life growing up in the outdoors of Minnesota. His studio work allowed him to create sharp images for magazines, but he craved new challenges. A trip to California’s Big Sur marked the beginning of his experimental, color-enhanced landscapes.",https://www.nytimes.com/paidpost/canon/driving-forces.html
